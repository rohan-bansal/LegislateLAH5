Prohibits a camp or children's non-regulated camp from applying pesticides to any playgrounds, athletic or playing fields, other than those on publicly-owned or publicly-leased property in a city of more than one million, except that (Sec. 1-1396-2): An emergency application of a pesticide may be made by a camp as determined by the county health department or for a county served by a district office of the Department of Health, such authority as the county legislature will designate, the commissioner or his or her designee; and An emergency application of a pesticide may be made by a children's non-regulated camp as determined by the commissioner or his or her designee. Specifies if a response to a request for an emergency application of pesticide is not received by a camp within 24 hours, the camp can contract with a pesticide applicator for a single application of pesticide, provided that the camp submit documentation of the emergency pesticide application to the county health department or the commissioner immediately thereafter. The documentation must include an explanation of the emergency, the date on which the camp requested approval for an emergency application of pesticide, the date and time the pesticide was applied, the pesticide or pesticides applied, and the name of the certified pesticide applicator who applied the pesticide (Sec. 1-1396-2). Requires the commissioner to have the power to exempt from this law any camp to the extent that it is not practicable to use pesticide alternatives (Sec. 1-1396-3). Amends environmental conservation law to ensure the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of education and the commissioner of health, will develop guidance on pesticide alternatives to facilitate compliance with existing law (Sec. 1-2)."}
