(2) Provides that an electricity supplier's net metering tariff must be made and remain available to customers until the earlier of: (A) January 1 of the first calendar year after the calendar year in which the aggregate amount of net metering facility nameplate capacity under the electricity supplier's net metering tariff equals at least 3% (versus 1.5% under current law) of the electricity supplier's most recent summer peak load; or (B) July 1, 2025 (versus July 1, 2022, under current law). (3) Provides that before July 1, 2022, an electricity supplier shall amend its net metering tariff, or file a new net metering tariff with the utility regulatory commission (IURC), to do the following: (A) Establish as the allowed limit on the aggregate amount of net metering facility nameplate capacity under the tariff an amount equal to at least 3% of the electricity supplier's most recent summer peak load. (B) Allow a public use customer that: (i) operates a net metering facility on a premises that the public use customer owns or controls before the installation of the net metering facility; and (ii) is billed by the electricity supplier for electricity measured at more than one meter; to choose to be billed or credited for the difference between the kilowatt hours delivered by the electricity supplier as measured by any one or more of those meters, not to exceed three, and the kilowatt hours generated and delivered to the electricity supplier by the net metering facility. (4) Provides that before July 1, 2022, the IURC shall make similar amendments to its net metering rules. (5) Specifies that any repairs, updates, or upgrades to portions of a net metering facility that do not increase the nameplate capacity of the net metering facility are not considered a replacement of the net metering facility for purposes of certain provisions providing for the extended availability of an electricity supplier's net metering tariff for customers that install a net metering facility before certain specified deadlines. (6) Specifies that net metering customers must comply with certain safety, performance, and reliability standards with which customers that produce distributed generation must comply. (7) Specifies that a net metering customer has certain rights regarding the installation and ownership of a net metering facility that a customer that produces distributed generation has with respect to the installation and ownership of distributed generation equipment. (8) Adds a noncode provision staying the implementation of a rate or tariff for the procurement of excess distributed generation for which an electricity supplier has applied or received approval from the IURC under current law, until such time as the conditions for the expiration of the electricity supplier's net metering tariff, as set forth in the bill, apply to the electricity supplier.", "pending_committee_id": 3141, "committee": {"committee_id": 3141, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 37, "name": "Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2022-01-06", "committee_id": 3141, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 37, "name": "Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications"}], "history": [{"date": "2022-01-06", "action": "Authored by Representative Cook", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 37, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2022-01-06", "action": "Coauthored by Representative Schaibley", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 37, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2022-01-06", "action": "First reading: referred to Committee on Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 37, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2022-01-25", "action": "Representative Hamilton added as coauthor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 37, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16807, "person_hash": "govpj6kk", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 14, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Anthony Cook", "first_name": "Anthony", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Cook", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-032", "ftm_eid": 28306262, "votesmart_id": 156199, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 521999, "ballotpedia": "Tony_Cook", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 16801, "person_hash": "4ah04ilc", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 14, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Donna Schaibley", "first_name": "Donna", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Schaibley", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-024", "ftm_eid": 6982379, "votesmart_id": 156198, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 521995, "ballotpedia": "Donna_Schaibley", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 18543, "person_hash": "qzgvyoto", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 14, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Carey Hamilton", "first_name": "Carey", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Hamilton", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-087", "ftm_eid": 15301806, "votesmart_id": 174304, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 595670, "ballotpedia": "Carey_Hamilton", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2465015, "date": "2022-01-05", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/IN/text/HB1136/id/2465015", "state_link": "http://iga.in.gov/static-documents/d/9/d/1/d9d1087e/HB1136.01.INTR.pdf", "text_size": 224758, "text_hash": "7864c7ecf693696ff7b8936327f2a5e8"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 220095, "date": "2022-01-05", "type": "Fiscal Note", "type_id": 1, "title": "Fiscal Note", "description": "Fiscal Note #1: Introduced House Bill (H)", "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/IN/supplement/HB1136/id/220095", "state_link": "http://iga.in.gov/static-documents/a/8/8/9/a8894d93/HB1136.01.INTR.FN001.pdf", "supplement_size": 74609, "supplement_hash": "87629d30d8c1d5a5e2515d3c0c64ead8"}], "calendar": []}}
