Electric utility regulation; net energy metering. Authorizes any eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator to enter into a contract to sell any net metering eligible energy exceeding the eligible customer-generator's or eligible agricultural customer-generator's own energy demand for any monthly period to any other retail customer within the same service territory of the incumbent utility. The measure increases the maximum size of the aggregate generating facility that qualifies for (i) the agricultural net energy metering program from 500 kilowatts to two megawatts, (ii) the net metering program for residential eligible customer-generators from 20 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts, and (iii) the net metering program for nonresidential eligible customer-generators from one megawatt to two megawatts. The measure replaces the existing provision that allows an eligible agricultural customer-generator to be served by multiple meters that are located at separate but contiguous sites with a provision that allows such a customer-generator to be served by multiple meters that are located on one parcel or on multiple adjacent parcels. The measure repeals the provision that caps the size of a generation facility of an eligible customer-generator at his expected annual energy consumption. The measure also (a) replaces the existing provision that provides that an eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator will be paid for excess electricity at the rate that is provided for such purchases in a net metering standard contract or tariff approved by the State Corporation Commission with a requirement that they will be paid at a rate equal to the customer-generator's approved customer rate schedule plus all applicable riders and (b) repeals the provision that limits the net energy metering programs to one percent of each electric distribution company's adjusted", "pending_committee_id": 161, "committee": {"committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2016-02-02", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-02-02", "action": "Unanimous consent to introduce", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-02", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 16104820D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-02", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-02-15", "action": "Committee substitute printed to Web only 16105574D-S1", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-15", "action": "Incorporates SB148", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-15", "action": "Continued to 2017 in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-12-02", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 794, "person_hash": "oq7zo4xz", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Richard Stuart", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "H.", "last_name": "Stuart", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-028", "ftm_eid": 6136944, "votesmart_id": 90324, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 260391, "ballotpedia": "Richard_Stuart,_Virginia_Senator", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 766, "person_hash": "ib2vxbt5", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Edwards", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Edwards", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-021", "ftm_eid": 13013704, "votesmart_id": 8263, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199403, "ballotpedia": "John_Edwards,_Virginia_Senator", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 271, "subject_name": "Public Service Companies"}, {"subject_id": 169185, "subject_name": "Electric Companies"}, {"subject_id": 169244, "subject_name": "Utility Services"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1428151, "date": "2016-02-02", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB779/id/1428151", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+SB779+hil", "text_size": 14977, "text_hash": "85036cdf4a18e02413576e44d8ae072e"}, {"doc_id": 1428152, "date": "2016-02-15", "type": "Comm Sub", "type_id": 2, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB779/id/1428152", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+SB779S1+hil", "text_size": 14560, "text_hash": "67a458f836467ce90552cc58c41a2c7b"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 562009, "date": "2016-02-15", "desc": "Senate: Continued to 2017 in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB779/id/562009", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+vot+S02C0075+SB0779"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
