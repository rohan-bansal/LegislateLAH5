(Sec. 205) Authorizes the CBP/ICE (formerly the U.S. Customs Service) to reliquidate an entry and refund any excess duties (including merchandise processing fees) paid on a good qualifying under the rules of origin for which no claim for preferential treatment was made at the time of importation if the importer takes certain actions within one year after such importation.

Exempts from such an investigation any Korean articles receiving import relief under the Agreement. Allows any entity filing such a petition to request provisional relief. (Sec. 313) Requires the President, after receiving an affirmative injury determination from the ITC, to provide (including the extension) in the aggregate up to three-years of import relief to remedy or prevent such injury and to facilitate efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.

(Sec. 332) Authorizes the President, if an affirmative serious damage determination is made, to provide certain import relief to remedy or prevent the damage and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry, including to suspend further reductions provided for in the Agreement in the duty imposed on the article or increase the rate of duty imposed on the article to a level that does not exceed an amount determined according to a specified formula.
