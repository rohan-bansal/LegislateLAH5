Authorizes municipal renewable energy net metering projects. Participating municipalities are authorized to aggregate the electric energy load of their governmental buildings, facilities, and any other governmental operations requiring the consumption of electric energy for the purpose of net energy metering from a renewable energy generating facility. To be eligible, the generation facility for the municipal renewable energy net metering project shall use as its sole energy source solar power, wind power, or aerobic or anaerobic digester gas and landfill gas; not have an aggregate generation capacity of more than five megawatts unless a utility elects a higher capacity; be located on land owned, leased, or operated by the municipality; be interconnected and operated in parallel with an electric utility's transmission and distribution facilities; and be used primarily to provide energy to metered accounts of the municipality. The aggregated municipal net metered accounts may be served by multiple meters that are located at separate sites. The measure also requires the State Corporation Commission, by July 1, 2015, to establish a program of multifamily net energy metering, which will allow a customer or customers that operate a renewable energy generating facility in a condominium, apartment complex, or homeowners association served by a common distribution circuit to be an eligible multifamily net metering customer-generator. The generation facility for multifamily net metering shall use as its total source of fuel renewable energy; not have an aggregate generation capacity of more than 500 kilowatts; be located on land owned or controlled by the eligible condominium, apartment complex, or homeowners association or on customers' property within the condominium, apartment complex, or homeowners association; be interconnected and operated in parallel with an electric utility's transmission and distribution facilities; and be used primarily to provide energy to metered accounts of the eligible multifamily net metering customer-generator. Each eligible multifamily net metering customer-generator shall own the energy transmitted by the renewable energy system until drawn from the grid at each eligible multifamily net metering customer-generator's residence. Eligible multifamily net metering customer-generators are exempt from the monthly standby charge assessed on other eligible customer-generators.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2014-01-08", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2014-01-08", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/08/14 14103405D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2014-01-08", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2014-01-15", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Special Subcommittee on Energy", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2014-01-30", "action": "Subcommittee recommends laying on the table by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2014-02-12", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 14064, "person_hash": "1hh2ifae", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Rob Krupicka", "first_name": "K.
