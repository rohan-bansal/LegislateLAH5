The extended period also applies to: the preferential treatment of apparel articles wholly assembled, or components knit-to-shape and wholly assembled, in one or more beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries from yarns originating in the United States or one or more beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries or former beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, or both; and the third-country fabric program granting duty-free treatment of apparel articles wholly assembled, or knit-to-shape and wholly assembled, or both, in one or more lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, regardless of the country of origin of the fabric or the yarn used to make such articles. This bill amends the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to revise rules of origin for duty-free treatment of articles of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. The President must not terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country unless, at least 60 days before termination, the President notifies Congress and the country of that intention. The President, instead of terminating the designation, may withdraw, suspend, or limit the duty-free treatment for any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if that would be more effective in promoting the country's compliance with certain requirements, including a market-based economy and the rule of law, the protection of human rights and internationally-recognized worker rights, elimination of trade barriers to the United States, and non-engagement in activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests or support acts of international terrorism. The President shall: publish annually in the Federal Register a notice of review and request for public comments on whether beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries are meeting the eligibility requirements for preferential treatment under AGOA and the Trade Act of 1974, and establish a process for interested persons to file a petition with the United States Trade Representative regarding the compliance of sub-Saharan African countries with such requirements. It is the sense of Congress that beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries should develop strategies biennially for more effective utilization of AGOA trade benefits. It is U.S. policy to continue to seek to deepen and expand trade and investment ties between sub-Saharan African and the United States through specified actions. This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend duty-free treatment under the GSP through December 31, 2017. The President may designate certain cotton articles as eligible for duty-free treatment only for least-developed beneficiary developing countries. The competitive need limitation and waiver requirements under the GSP shall apply to certain import-sensitive articles exported (directly or indirectly) from beneficiary developing countries to the United States during calendar 2014. This bill amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to extend through December 19, 2025, the duty-free entry of apparel articles, including woven articles and certain knit articles, assembled in Haiti and imported from Haiti or the Dominican Republic to the United States. The special duty-free rules for Haiti shall now extend through September 30, 2025. This bill amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1958 to extend customs user fees for certain customs services performed through July 7, 2025. The required installment of corporate estimated tax payments for a corporation with assets of at least $1 billion which is otherwise due in the third quarter of 2020 shall be increased by 5.25%.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2015-04-20", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-04-20", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9489, "person_hash": "y03u5uak", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Orrin Hatch", "first_name": "Orrin", "middle_name": "G.", "last_name": "Hatch", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-UT", "ftm_eid": 1673075, "votesmart_id": 53352, "opensecrets_id": "N00009869", "knowwho_pid": 165279, "ballotpedia": "Orrin_Hatch", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "HB1891", "sast_bill_id": 772684}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB1267", "sast_bill_id": 778083}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB1295", "sast_bill_id": 745187}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13682, "subject_name": "Africa"}, {"subject_id": 13489, "subject_name": "Caribbean area"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13148, "subject_name": "Corporate finance and management"}, {"subject_id": 20695, "subject_name": "Customs enforcement"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 13532, "subject_name": "Haiti"}, {"subject_id": 13235, "subject_name": "Latin America"}, {"subject_id": 13678, "subject_name": "Tariffs"}, {"subject_id": 13319, "subject_name": "Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}, {"subject_id": 13694, "subject_name": "Trade agreements and negotiations"}, {"subject_id": 13616, "subject_name": "U.S. and foreign investments"}, {"subject_id": 13648, "subject_name": "User charges and fees"}, {"subject_id": 13731, "subject_name": "Foreign trade and international finance"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1216817, "date": "2015-04-27", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1009/id/1216817", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s1009/BILLS-114s1009is.pdf", "text_size": 284906, "text_hash": "ec346aa777e770ccef1739d1a02a2193"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
