Report contents must: identify electric capacity resources available to the transmission organization; describe the fuel sources and operational characteristics of each electric capacity resource; evaluate the financial health, viability, and projected remaining years of service of these available electric capacity resources; and assess the current and projected reliability of the elements of the bulk-power system under the transmission organization's control. Subsequent to this report, transmission organizations must also submit tariff amendments that would achieve specified objectives, including a diverse generation portfolio and the availability of transmission facilities and transmission support services that would provide a continuous supply of electricity for customers. The bill shields any person from liability for actions taken to comply with a FERC order for temporary connections and exchanges of facilities during war or an energy emergency.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2015-05-06", "committee_id": 2324, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Energy And Natural Resources"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-05-06", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2015-05-19", "action": "Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
