Directs the State Corporation Commission to encourage investor-owned electric utilities to file tariffs with rate structures that reflect time of day and seasonal cost differentials. In proceedings that involve a new or amended retail rate structure, the Commission is directed to consider several factors, including the extent to which the rates are designed to align with the utility's marginal cost of providing service at different times of the day. In such rate structure proceedings, electric utilities may seek, and the Commission may approve, financial incentives for the implementation of creative rate options that would allow the utility and its customers to share the economic benefits of rate structures that lower the utility's fuel costs. The measure also directs the Commission to give the highest level of priority in its development of the electric energy consumer education program to efforts to increase consumer awareness and knowledge of electricity rate structures and the overall cost of electricity.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2010-01-22", "action": "House: Presented and ordered printed 10102617D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-01-22", "action": "House: Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2010-01-29", "action": "House: Assigned C & L sub: #3 Special Subcommittee on Energy", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-02-09", "action": "House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (9-Y 3-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-02-16", "action": "House: Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 1471, "person_hash": "z81xcdd3", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Mark Keam", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "Keam", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-035", "ftm_eid": 1359222, "votesmart_id": 111170, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 282951, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Keam", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 478397, "date": "2010-01-22", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB1358/id/478397", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+HB1358+hil", "text_size": 5585, "text_hash": "81248dcf6d3572cce7469dfa1ae096b1"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 133792, "date": "2010-02-09", "desc": "House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (9-Y 3-N)", "yea": 9, "nay": 3, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 12, "passed": 1, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB1358/id/133792", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+vot+H1403V0013+HB1358"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
