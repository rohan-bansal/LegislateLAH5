TITLE V--SMALL BUSINESS TRADE ISSUES AND STATE TRADE COORDINATION Small Business Trade Enhancement Act of 2015 or State Trade Coordination Act (Sec. 502) This bill amends the Small Business Act to require the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to convene an Interagency Working Group within 30 days after the President notifies Congress of the intention to enter into negotiations with foreign countries with respect to trade agreements for the reduction or elimination of tariff or nontariff barriers. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy shall by certain deadlines after convening the Group: identify diverse groups of small businesses to provide to the Group the views of small businesses in the manufacturing, services, and agriculture industries on the potential economic effects of the agreements; and report to Congress on the economic impacts of such agreements on small businesses. (Sec. 503) The SBA's Office of International Trade shall establish the State Trade Expansion Program to make grants to states for trade expansion programs for eligible small business concerns. The Office may, in carrying out the program, make competitive grants to states to increase the number of small business concerns exploring significant new trade opportunities.

(Sec. 504) This bill amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to direct the President to establish a State and Federal Export Promotion Coordination Working Group as a subcommittee of the Trade Promotion Coordination Committee (TPCC) to develop a strategy for improving coordination of federal and state resources for small business export promotion and export financing activities. The Office of International Trade shall report to Congress on recommendations for improving the experience of the Export.gov (or a successor) website as a comprehensive export information resource and a single website for exporters to submit all federally required information on the exportation of articles from the United States.

TITLE VI--ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS (Sec. 601) This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to revise requirements for the identification of U.S. trade expansion priorities. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) shall consult with Congress to prioritize, investigate, and resolve acts, policies, or practices of foreign countries that raise concerns with respect to obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements or any other trade agreement to which the United States is a party, or that otherwise creates barriers to U.S. goods, services, or investment. (Sec. 602) The USTR may take action to suspend concessions or other obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act if: enforcement action has terminated that was taken by the USTR to protect U.S. rights under any trade agreement or to eliminate an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country that violates that agreement or burdens or restricts U.S. commerce; the petitioner or any representative of the domestic industry that would benefit from reinstatement of such action requests the USTR for reinstatement; and the USTR meets certain consultation requirements. (Sec. 603) The USITC shall make an import monitoring tool available on a website to allow public access to data on the volume and value of imported goods to assess whether that data has changed over time. (Sec. 604) The bill establishes within the Office of the USTR an Interagency Center on Trade Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement to investigate disputes under the WTO as well as bilateral and regional trade agreements to which the United States is a party. (Sec. 605) DHS shall deposit into a special account certain interest earned on amounts realized by CBP on AD or CV duties through payments received by CBP on or after October 1, 2014. The interest shall be included in any CBP duty distributions to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenses. (Sec. 606) CBP shall ensure that appropriate resources address concerns that honey as well as illicit cultural property, archaeological or ethnological materials, and fish, wildlife, and plants are being imported into the United States in violation of U.S. customs laws.

(Sec. 608) The CBP shall direct appropriate personnel and the use of its resources, including a database of the individual characteristics of honey produced in foreign countries, to address concerns that honey is being imported into the United States in violation of U.S. customs and trade laws. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Food and Drug Administration should establish promptly a national standard of identity for honey for the CBP to use to ensure that imports of honey are: (1) classified accurately for purposes of assessing duties, and (2) denied entry into the United States if such imports pose a threat to the health or safety of U.S. consumers. (Sec. 609) The Office of the USTR shall now include one presidentially appointed Chief Innovation and Intellectual Property Negotiator, who shall conduct trade negotiations and enforce trade agreements with respect to U.S. intellectual property as well as take appropriate actions to address foreign acts, policies, and practices with a significant adverse impact on the value of U.S. innovation. (Sec. 610) The USTR shall develop, within 90 days after submission of the National Trade Estimate, an action plan of certain benchmarks for achieving adequate protection of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, for each foreign country placed and remaining on a priority watch list for at least one year. Amounts from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (established under section 611 of this title) may be expended by the USTR, but only as provided by appropriations Acts, to provide assistance to any developing country on the priority watch list to comply with the benchmarks in the action plan.

(Sec. 702) The bill establishes an Advisory Committee on International Exchange Rate Policy to advise Treasury on the impact of international exchange rates and financial policies on the U.S. economy. Appropriations are authorized.

There is established in the CBP: a Deputy Commissioner; the U.S. Border Patrol; an Office of Air and Marine Operations, including an Air and Marine Operations Center; an Office of Field Operations, including a National Targeting Center; an Office of Intelligence ; an Office of International Affairs; and an Office of Professional Responsibility. The CBP shall establish, and update triennially, certain standard operating procedures for CBP personnel. The CBP shall report annually to Congress on whether use of unmanned aerial systems (drones) conforms to such procedures. The CBP shall require all CBP agents and officers to participate in a specified amount of continuing education to maintain an understanding of federal legal rulings, court decisions, and departmental policies, procedures, and guidelines. The CBP shall ensure that: adequate access to food and water is provided as soon as possible to individuals apprehended and detained at or between a U.S. port of entry, and detainee rights are provided at CBP processing centers. The CBP shall publish wait times for travelers entering at the 20 U.S. airports with the highest volume of international travel and make this information available to the public on the CBP website. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall be maintained as a distinct entity within DHS. The Office for Domestic Preparedness is removed from within the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security and establishes it simply within DHS. The functions of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security shall be transferred to the DHS Secretary. The DHS Secretary (currently, the Under Secretary) may impose disciplinary action on any employee of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP who willfully deceives Congress or agency leadership on any matter. The bill establishes in the CBP an Office of Trade. The CBP shall transfer all functions of the Office of International Trade to the Office of Trade. The Office of International Trade shall be abolished.

DHS shall not enter into or renew an agreement with a foreign country government for a CBP-administered trusted traveler program unless that government certifies that it: routinely submits information about lost and stolen passports of its citizens and nationals to INTERPOL's Stolen and Lost Travel Document database, or makes such information available to the United States through another comparable means of reporting. The DHS shall submit to Congress a plan to create an agricultural specialist career track within CBP. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Foreign Language Award Program incentivizes CBP officers to attain and maintain competency in a foreign language. Subtitle B--Preclearance Operations Preclearance Authorization Act of 2015 (Sec. 813) Provided there is a valid aviation security preclearance agreement, DHS may establish CBP preclearance operations in a foreign country to: prevent terrorists, instruments of terrorism, and other security threats from entering the United States; prevent inadmissible persons from entering the United States; ensure merchandise destined for the United States complies with applicable U.S. customs laws; and ensure the prompt processing of persons eligible to travel to the United States. (Sec. 814) At least 60 days before an agreement to establish CBP preclearance operations in a foreign country becomes valid, DHS shall provide Congress with a copy of the agreement as well as other information on CBP preclearance operations. The establishment of preclearance operations at an airport in a foreign country under an agreement shall be conditioned on the requirements that: at least one U.S. passenger carrier operates at the airport, and the access of all U.S. passenger carriers to those preclearance operations is the same as the access of any non-U.S. passenger carrier. The CBP shall report quarterly to Congress on: the number of CBP officers assigned from U.S. ports of entry to preclearance operations; and the number of positions at U.S. ports of entry vacated by CBP officers that have been filled by other hired, trained, and equipped CBP officers. At least 60 days after a determination that CBP processing times have significantly increased at U.S. ports of entry from which CBP officers were reassigned to preclearance operations, if the vacated positions have not been filled, the CBP shall submit to Congress an implementation plan for reducing processing times at such U.S. ports. (Sec. 815) The TSA shall rescreen in the United States passengers and their property before they are permitted into sterile areas of U.S. airports if they have come from an airport in a foreign country that has failed to maintain security and protocols comparable to those of the United States.

(Sec. 817) The CBP may enter into cost-sharing agreements with airports in foreign countries where preclearance operations have been established if: an executive agreement establishing such operations has been signed but not yet entered into force; and CBP has incurred, or expects to incur, initial preclearance operations costs. (Sec. 818) The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to authorize the Department of Justice to receive in advance reimbursement for the costs of immigration inspection services provided at an airport. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended similarly to authorize the Department of Agriculture to collect in advance the costs for preclearance operations with respect to animals or articles entering into the United States. TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (Sec. 901) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the USTR should encourage other countries to establish commercially meaningful de minimis values for express and postal shipments exempt from customs duties and taxes and from certain other entry documentation requirements. This bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to increase from $200 to $800 the general de minimis aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipment of duty-free articles imported by one person on one day. (Sec. 902) Specified deadlines shall now apply for DHS to trade and customs revenue consultation requirements of the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006. (Sec. 903) This bill also prescribes or revises requirements under the Tariff Act of 1930 and the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States for: certain penalties for customs brokers convicted of an act of terrorism; duty-free treatment of certain federal property exported and reimported without an advance in value or improvement in condition; duties on warranty repairs or alterations of articles exported from and then returned to the United States; exemption from duty treatment of the residue of bulk cargo contained in instruments of international traffic previously exported from the United States; drawback (refund of paid customs duties) on eligible merchandise imported into the United States and later exported or destroyed; assignment of CBP employees to perform customs services for charter flight passengers and their baggage; country of origin marking of certain castings imported into the United States; and elimination of the consumptive demand exception to the prohibition on the importation of goods made with convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor. (Sec. 906) The GAO shall report to Congress on the modernization of drawback and refunds. (Sec. 907) The CBP shall report to Congress within one year after entering into any agreement under: the program for entering into reimbursable fee agreements for the provision of CBP services, upon the request of any persons, at existing CBP-serviced facilities, at new facilities, and at land border facilities; the pilot program authorizing the CBP to enter into partnerships with private sector and government entities at ports of entry for certain services and to accept certain donations; the program where CBP collects a customs user fee at designated small airports and other facilities; or the program authorizing CBP to establish preclearance operations in foreign countries. (Sec. 909) The bill states certain trade policies regarding Israel, and principal U.S. trade negotiating objectives relating to Israel for proposed trade agreements with foreign countries regarding commercial partnerships. The President shall report to Congress on politically motivated boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel. No federal or state court shall recognize or enforce any foreign judgment entered against a U.S. person that conducts business operations in Israel, or any Israel-controlled territory, if the court determines that the foreign judgment is based, in whole or in part, on a foreign court determination that the U.S. person's conducting business operations in Israel or any Israel-controlled territory or with Israeli entities constitutes a violation of law. (Sec. 912) The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended to prescribe the duty-free treatment of certain recreational performance outerwear as well as of certain protective active footwear. (The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 is amended to repeal similar provisions with respect to such articles.) (Sec. 914) This bill amends the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 to revise the overall U.S. negotiating objectives for trade agreements with foreign countries for the reduction or elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers to ensure that such agreements do not require changes to U.S. immigration laws nor obligate the United States to greenhouse gas emissions measures. A new principal U.S. trade negotiating objective shall be to obtain competitive opportunities for U.S. exports of fish, seafood, and shellfish products in foreign markets equivalent to those opportunities afforded those foreign export items in U.S. markets. The bill revises the prohibition against applying trade authorities (fast track) procedures to congressional implementing bills for trade agreements with foreign countries that fail to make significant efforts to comply with minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking (\"tier 3\" country). The prohibition itself shall not apply, however, if the President submits to Congress a letter stating the country has taken concrete actions to implement the principal recommendations in the most recent annual report on trafficking in persons. (Sec. 915) The President may give preferential treatment to certain articles imported directly from Nepal into the U.S. customs territory if that country meets certain requirements under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, including a market-based economy and the rule of law, the protection of human rights and internationally-recognized worker rights, elimination of trade barriers to the United States, and non-engagement in activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests or support acts of international terrorism. Nepal must also meet certain eligibility criteria for designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Trade Act of 1974. Certain leather articles (trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attache cases, briefcases, school satchels and similar containers) and textile or apparel articles imported directly from Nepal may enter the U.S. customs territory duty-free if: the article is the growth, product, or manufacture of Nepal, or Nepal is a textile or apparel article's country of origin; the President determines, after receiving advice from the U.S. International Trade Commission, that the article is not import-sensitive; and the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in, and the manufacturing costs performed in, Nepal or the U.S. customs territory is at least 35% of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered. Limits to 15% of the appraised value of an article at the time it is entered the cost or value of the materials produced in, and the manufacturing costs performed in, the U.S. customs territory and attributed to the 35% requirement. The CBP must verify annually that textile and apparel articles imported duty-free into the United States from Nepal are not being unlawfully transshipped into the United States. The President shall establish a trade facilitation and capacity building program to assist Nepal in the export of goods. The extension of preferential treatment to Nepal shall terminate after December 31, 2025. (Sec. 916) The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 is amended to authorize the President to implement an agreement by members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation to reduce any rate of duty on certain environmental goods only if Congress is notified of agreement negotiations as well as U.S. objectives in those negotiations. (Sec. 917) The Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to require country of origin marking of certain castings, including inlet frames, tree and trench grates, lampposts, lamppost bases, cast utility poles, bollards, hydrants, and utility boxes. (Sec. 918) When the President submits to the Senate, under the Trade Act of 1974, a nomination for appointment as a Deputy USTR, the submission shall include information on the country, regional offices, and functions of the Office of the USTR with respect to which that individual will have responsibility.
