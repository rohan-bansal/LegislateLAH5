Reinstates much of the system under which investor-owned electric utilities were regulated prior to 1999. The measure repeals the Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act and reenacts provisions relating to State Corporation Commission (SCC) ratemaking, including provisions addressing the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs, that existed prior to the 2007 legislation that re-regulated most of Virginia's investor-owned electric utilities. Existing provisions of the Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act pertaining to ratemaking for electric cooperatives, to net energy metering, to consumer education programs, and to interconnections by farms are relocated to other chapters in Title 56. Rate adjustment clauses approved by the SCC will remain in effect as set forth in an enactment clause.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2011-01-10", "action": "Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/12/11 11103296D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-01-10", "action": "Senate: Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-01-31", "action": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (12-Y 2-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 785, "person_hash": "447umkrr", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Phillip Puckett", "first_name": "Phillip", "middle_name": "P.", "last_name": "Puckett", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-038", "ftm_eid": 5840131, "votesmart_id": 15734, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199420, "ballotpedia": "Phillip_Puckett", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 788, "person_hash": "0rv0ztx3", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Roscoe Reynolds", "first_name": "Roscoe", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Reynolds", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-020", "ftm_eid": 13013703, "votesmart_id": 5183, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199402, "ballotpedia": "Roscoe_Reynolds", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 196, "subject_name": "Conservation"}, {"subject_id": 225, "subject_name": "General Assembly"}, {"subject_id": 271, "subject_name": "Public Service Companies"}, {"subject_id": 289, "subject_name": "Taxation"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 86632, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB883/id/86632", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+SB883+hil", "text_size": 159327, "text_hash": "b915c08d7207eec19ee53f60829fce71"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 33087, "date": "2011-01-31", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (12-Y 2-N)", "yea": 12, "nay": 2, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB883/id/33087", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+vot+S02V0057+SB0883"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
