Removes provisions requiring payment of reasonable fees for a customer, alternative retail electric supplier, or unit of local government to access specified information from an electric utility. Requires that each electric utility serving at least 100,000 customers that procures power to file a tariff with the Commission that modifies its current tariff to require all retail customer advanced metering infrastructure meter usage data used for electric power and energy supply service. Provides that the tariff shall provide for the utility to reconcile load serving entity wholesale settlement statements with any necessary regional transmission organization or independent system operator using actual customer meter data and also provide that such customer's validated interval meter usage data be provided the next calendar day for all retail customers enrolled with an alternative retail electric supplier according to the electric utility's records that have contractually authorized release of such data. Provides that an alternative retail electric supplier and its affiliates and contracted third parties shall use such interval meter usage data for the development, marketing, and provision of providing current and future products or services related to retail electric supply service. Amends the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. Provides that an alternative retail electric supplier shall not warrant or otherwise represent to an electric utility that the alternative retail electric supplier is authorized to access the interval data of a current or prospective residential or small commercial retail customer unless the alternative retail electric supplier has obtained authorization.
