(4) Provides that before July 1, 2021, the IURC shall make similar amendments to its net metering rules. (5) Specifies that any repairs, updates, or upgrades to portions of a net metering facility that do not increase the nameplate capacity of the net metering facility are not considered a replacement of the net metering facility for purposes of certain provisions providing for the extended availability of an electricity supplier's net metering tariff for customers that install a net metering facility before certain specified deadlines. (6) Specifies that net metering customers must comply with certain safety, performance, and reliability standards with which customers that produce distributed generation must comply.
