Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to promulgate regulations requiring mandatory annual reports to disclose measures taken during the year to identify and address conditions of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor within the supply chains of the business entity.
