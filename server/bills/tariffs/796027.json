The President shall establish an interagency coordinating committee to develop a biennial governmentwide joint strategic plan for trade capacity building in developing countries. The State Department shall: establish a trade capacity advisory committee, and establish a pilot project to coordinate a whole-of-government effort to expand U.S. efforts in trade facilitation assistance for developing countries. U.S. embassies in trade facilitation pilot countries shall develop biennially a specific trade facilitation assistance component for their mission plans. The State Department may designate developing countries to participate in the trade facilitation assistance pilot program. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended to place on the chief of mission to a foreign country responsibility to coordinate and supervise the implementation of all U.S. trade-related and trade capacity assistance among all federal departments and agencies present in that country (except for assistance under the control of a U.S. area military commander). In developing trade capacity embassy mission plans on trade capacity, the trade capacity mission team shall convene local representatives of the U.S. private sector to consult on issues affecting trade capacity at the borders of participating countries. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to exempt from the prohibition against police training in a foreign country any training and technical assistance for customs and transportation authorities and personnel in recipient countries to implement priority trade capacity building assistance.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2015-10-22", "committee_id": 2327, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Foreign Relations"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-10-22", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-06-23", "action": "Committee on Foreign Relations.
