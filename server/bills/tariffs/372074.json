Requires the State Corporation Commission, when determining whether to approve a utility's proposed standby charge methodology, to find that (i) the methodology utilized by the supplier is generally accepted in the industry for making such determinations, (ii) the methodology proposed by the supplier calculates costs based upon sample statistics derived solely from the class of residential eligible customer-generators, and (iii) the quantity of the class of residential eligible customer-generators represents a sufficient base to form reasonable statistical conclusions. These criteria are in addition to the existing requirement that the standby charges collected from eligible customer-generators allow the supplier to recover only the portion of the supplier's infrastructure costs that are properly associated with serving eligible customer-generators. The measure also provides that the supplier's infrastructure costs include, in addition to the direct costs associated with the supplier's infrastructure, an offset for any benefits derived from any net energy metering provided by eligible customer-generators to the supplier. Finally, the measure requires the Commission to deny a utility's application for standby charges if its methodology fails to consider all four of the criteria.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2012-01-18", "action": "Senate: Presented and ordered printed 12104128D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-18", "action": "Senate: Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2012-02-06", "action": "Senate: Continued to 2013 in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 766, "person_hash": "ib2vxbt5", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Edwards", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Edwards", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-021", "ftm_eid": 13013704, "votesmart_id": 8263, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199403, "ballotpedia": "John_Edwards,_Virginia_Senator", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 218, "subject_name": "Energy Conservation and Resources"}, {"subject_id": 271, "subject_name": "Public Service Companies"}, {"subject_id": 286, "subject_name": "State Corporation Commission"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 541922, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB582/id/541922", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+SB582+hil", "text_size": 9861, "text_hash": "040acd48ccc776ee7c4c66ff5bd7ec24"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 151634, "date": "2012-02-06", "desc": "Senate: Continued to 2013 in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB582/id/151634", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+vot+S02V0052+SB0582"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
