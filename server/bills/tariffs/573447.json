Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to a fair comparison, for purposes of an antidumping investigation or review, between the actual or constructed export price of subject merchandise and its normal value. Requires an increase in the normal value price determination by the difference, if any, between the actual cost of producing the merchandise and the estimated cost of producing that merchandise if the producer paid its employees adequate wages and maintained sustainable production methods. Requires the administering authority, at the request of an exporter or producer of subject merchandise, to reduce the amount of that increase (credit) by an amount that reflects the extent to which the merchandise was produced under conditions under which all employees receive adequate wages and sustainable production methods are maintained. Authorizes an exporter or producer seeking to import merchandise into the United States to request the administering authority to issue a precertification that the merchandise is eligible for credits before an investigation is initiated. Allows the administering authority to issue a precertification for all merchandise imported from a country if that country's government maintains and enforces laws requiring all producers of such merchandise in that country to pay its employees adequate wages and to maintain sustainable production methods. Authorizes the administering authority, the Secretary of Labor, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish jointly procedures pursuant to which obtaining certification from an independent, third-party, standards-setting organization may demonstrate the eligibility for a precertification of an exporter or producer or of a country.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2013-12-11", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2013-12-11", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9469, "person_hash": "58q1t500", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jeff Merkley", "first_name": "Jeff", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Merkley", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OR", "ftm_eid": 13005237, "votesmart_id": 23644, "opensecrets_id": "N00029303", "knowwho_pid": 198129, "ballotpedia": "Jeff_Merkley", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9004, "person_hash": "mzzpsyfc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Tammy Baldwin", "first_name": "Tammy", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Baldwin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-WI-2", "ftm_eid": 2924660, "votesmart_id": 3470, "opensecrets_id": "N00004367", "knowwho_pid": 159127, "ballotpedia": "Tammy_Baldwin", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13742, "subject_name": "Canada"}, {"subject_id": 13452, "subject_name": "Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"}, {"subject_id": 13169, "subject_name": "Economic performance and conditions"}, {"subject_id": 13180, "subject_name": "Energy efficiency and conservation"}, {"subject_id": 13740, "subject_name": "Environmental health"}, {"subject_id": 13743, "subject_name": "Free trade and trade barriers"}, {"subject_id": 13205, "subject_name": "Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"}, {"subject_id": 13898, "subject_name": "Industrial policy and productivity"}, {"subject_id": 13234, "subject_name": "Labor standards"}, {"subject_id": 13235, "subject_name": "Latin America"}, {"subject_id": 13701, "subject_name": "Manufacturing"}, {"subject_id": 13243, "subject_name": "Mexico"}, {"subject_id": 13678, "subject_name": "Tariffs"}, {"subject_id": 13694, "subject_name": "Trade agreements and negotiations"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13468, "subject_name": "Worker safety and health"}, {"subject_id": 13731, "subject_name": "Foreign trade and international finance"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 902215, "date": "2013-12-17", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1801/id/902215", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/s1801/BILLS-113s1801is.pdf", "text_size": 269553, "text_hash": "3dfb47f068f6fd976c108a9a0322f623"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
