Requires the State Corporation Commission to establish a program of community net metering, which will allow a group of residential, small commercial, and other customers to establish an \"eligible community customer\" to act collectively to generate renewable energy for their own use. Members of an eligible community customer develop a net metered system that provides that excess generation by some members of the group will be used to offset consumption by other members within the group. The generating capacity of an eligible community customer's facility shall not exceed two megawatts at a single site but may exceed the amount of electricity provided by the incumbent electric utility over a net metering period at the site that hosts the generation facility. If electricity generated by the generation facility or facilities within the eligible community customer group in a year exceeds the net electricity consumption by members of the group, the utility shall reduce the eligible community customer's bill for the next monthly billing period by the amount of the excess. The measure also creates a category of eligible customer-generators for operators of agricultural net metering facilities that have a capacity not exceeding two megawatts.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2010-01-12", "action": "House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/10 10103724D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-01-12", "action": "House: Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2010-01-29", "action": "House: Assigned C & L sub: #3 Special Subcommittee on Energy", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-02-09", "action": "House: Subcommittee recommends continuing to 2011 (12-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-02-11", "action": "House: Continued to 2011 in Commerce and Labor by voice vote", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 707, "person_hash": "np9rx7vx", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Steven Landes", "first_name": "R.
