Provides that a net metering tariff of an electric utility other than a municipally owned utility or a rural electric membership corporation (electricity supplier) must remain available to the electricity supplier's customers until: (1) the aggregate amount of net metering facility nameplate capacity under the tariff equals at least 5% (rather than 1.5% under current law) of the electricity supplier's most recent summer peak load; or (2) July 1, 2027 (rather than July 1, 2022, under current law); whichever occurs earlier. Provides that an electricity supplier may not offer a net metering tariff to the electricity supplier's customers after June 30, 2027 (rather than June 30, 2022, under current law). Provides for net metering tariffs to be phased out by July 1, 2052, and provides that an electricity supplier may not change the terms and conditions of the electricity supplier's net metering tariff during the phase out period. Requires the Indiana utility regulatory commission (IURC) to amend the IURC's rules to allow participation in a net metering tariff by a net metering facility with a nameplate capacity of five megawatts or less. (Under current law, IURC rules allow participation in a net metering tariff by a net metering facility with a nameplate capacity of one megawatt or less.) Allows a customer to apply the output measured at up to five of the customer's electric meters for purposes of determining the difference between: (1) the amount of electricity supplied to the customer by an electricity supplier; and (2) the amount of electricity that is supplied back to the electricity supplier by the customer; for purposes of determining the kilowatt difference for which the customer is billed or credited. Requires the IURC to: (1) engage an independent consultant to conduct a study regarding the value of distributed energy resources to Indiana; (2) conduct a formal investigation and one or more stakeholder meetings regarding the results of the study; and (3) based on the IURC's findings and conclusions, adopt rules not later than December 31, 2023: (A) establishing one or more distributed energy resource tariffs; and (B) requiring an electricity supplier to, not later than January 31, 2024, offer a distributed energy resource tariff to the electricity supplier's existing and new customers. Provides that, notwithstanding the statutory phase out of net metering tariffs, if an electricity supplier offers a net metering tariff to the electricity supplier's customers, the electricity supplier must continue to offer the net metering tariff until the electricity supplier adopts a distributed energy resource tariff. Stays the implementation of a rate for procurement of excess distributed generation for which an electricity supplier has applied for or received approval by the IURC under current law.", "pending_committee_id": 2722, "committee": {"committee_id": 2722, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 38, "name": "Utilities"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-01-14", "committee_id": 2722, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 38, "name": "Utilities"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-01-14", "action": "Authored by Senator Yoder", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 38, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-14", "action": "First reading: referred to Committee on Utilities", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 38, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 22087, "person_hash": "dcvlp4vo", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 14, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Shelli Yoder", "first_name": "Shelli", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Yoder", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-040", "ftm_eid": 17657992, "votesmart_id": 135982, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 395644, "ballotpedia": "Shelli_Yoder", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2240935, "date": "2021-01-13", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/IN/text/SB0420/id/2240935", "state_link": "http://iga.in.gov/static-documents/e/1/b/f/e1bf771c/SB0420.01.INTR.pdf", "text_size": 194918, "text_hash": "8f57b1ccd3bf7fbdf35c5539f8b6078e"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 129890, "date": "2021-01-13", "type": "Fiscal Note", "type_id": 1, "title": "Fiscal Note", "description": "Fiscal Note #1: Introduced Senate Bill (S)", "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/IN/supplement/SB0420/id/129890", "state_link": "http://iga.in.gov/static-documents/3/d/f/8/3df8661a/SB0420.01.INTR.FN001.pdf", "supplement_size": 75398, "supplement_hash": "8aae115deffcb20ddfff64e33232d227"}], "calendar": []}}
