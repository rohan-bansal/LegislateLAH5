The bill amends the definition of \u201ccosmetology\u201d to include singeing, braiding and pressing of hair. Pursuant to the proposed bill, individuals who practice in these areas must be licensed. Further, schools must become accredited. With respect to accreditation, a grandfather clause exempts schools that have been continually licensed and in good standing for more than five years prior to enactment of the statute. The bill changes the Board composition to more accurately reflect the licensee population. There will be 13 Board members: 2 cosmetologists, 2 nail technicians, 2 barbers, 2 aestheticians, 1 electrologist, 1 cosmetology instructor and 3 public members. Pursuant to the proposed bill, agents of the Division will have the authority to inspect shops and schools, both licensed and unlicensed. The Board will have the authority to require continuing education of licensees. Licensure requirements for nail technicians have been amended to update training and apprenticeship hours. A grandfather provision for nail technician apprentices is included. This amendment will bring Delaware up to the standards of most other states. Licensure requirements for instructors have also been clarified and updated. The bill states that a cosmetology instructor may also teach electrology, nail technology and aesthetics. A grandfather provision for licensure of barbering instructors is included. The bill creates two levels of licensure for barbers: barbers and master barbers. The type of license issued will depend on the applicant\u2019s training and the examination taken. A grandfather clause is included. The bill amends the two-year late renewal period to one year and allows for the licensee to renew a lapsed license up to 4 years before requiring reinstatement. The bill amends reciprocity requirements such that an applicant coming from a state with less stringent requirements shall have worked for 5 years in the home state preceding application. The bill amends disciplinary sanctions to include a civil penalty. The provision relating to unlicensed practice has been changed to include fines for shop owners and managers. The bill amends the qualifications for licensure of aestheticians to update the education hours and the apprenticeship hours. A grandfather provision for aesthetician apprentices is included. In addition, the hour requirements for schools have been updated. The course of study must be not less than 600 hours. These changes are needed to bring Delaware licensure standards into line with those in most other states. The bill also updates the requirements for licensure as an aesthetics\u2019 instructor, again, to ensure that Delaware meets national standards. A grandfather clause is included: a licensed aesthetician who has been teaching aesthetics prior to enactment of the statute, and who provides the Board with proof of not less than 900 hours of teaching experience, is exempted from the section. This bill becomes effective one year after its enactment into law.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2009-04-09", "committee_id": 1699, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Sunset Committee (Policy Analysis & Government Accountability)"}, {"date": "2009-06-04", "committee_id": 1694, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 26, "name": "Sunset"}], "history": [{"date": "2009-04-09", "action": "Introduced and Assigned to Sunset Committee (Policy Analysis & Government Accountability) Committee in House", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2009-04-30", "action": "Reported Out of Committee (SUNSET COMMITTEE (POLICY ANALYSIS & GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY)) in House with 4 Favorable, 1 On Its Merits", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2009-05-14", "action": "Passed by House of Representatives.
