Provides that a public utility shall demonstrate to the Illinois Commerce Commission that existing customers will not subsidize the cost of new facilities beyond what is provided for in rules and in excess of certain payments by customers for the Commission to approve new construction. Provides that the Commission's order concerning new construction shall explicitly address the economic impact on customers. Requires the Commission to annually report to the General Assembly a gas utility's projects related to a qualifying infrastructure plant, the projected timeline for the replacement of the cast iron and bare and vintage steel in the utility's system, and whether that timeline is adequate to address public safety concerns and reliability. Provides that when a gas public utility connects an applicant to its gas distribution system, certain costs associated with investments in plant additions shall be excluded from a cost-recovery mechanism that allocates the excess cost among existing customers. Requires the Commission to investigate each gas public utility tariff that provides for gas main extensions without additional charge to new customers. Requires the Commission to initiate a rulemaking proceeding providing for rules to establish a uniform method by which a natural gas public utility determines the value of a gas main extension provided to new customers without additional charge.", "pending_committee_id": 235, "committee": {"committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-02-07", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, {"date": "2019-02-19", "committee_id": 231, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Public Utilities"}, {"date": "2019-02-28", "committee_id": 4079, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Regulatory Matters"}, {"date": "2019-03-29", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-02-06", "action": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
