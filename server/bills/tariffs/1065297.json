Reduces Electric utilities; retail competition. Reduces the amount of the demand of an investor-owned electric utility's customer that makes the customer eligible to purchase electric power from any licensed supplier from five megawatts to one megawatt. The measure shortens the period that a utility's customer who switches from an investor-owned electric utility to a competing supplier is barred from returning as a customer of its utility from five years to three months. The measure revises the methodology for calculating certain costs for customers of an investor-owned electric utility that receive an exemption from the lock-out period. The measure (i) allows customers of an investor-owned electric utility to purchase 100 percent renewable energy from any licensed supplier and (ii) eliminates the condition that permits such purchases only if the incumbent investor-owned electric utility does not offer a tariff for 100 percent renewable energy. The measure does not change the existing corresponding requirements applicable to cooperative electric utilities.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-19", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2018-01-23", "committee_id": 3860, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Subcommittee #3"}, {"date": "2018-02-13", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-19", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 18105515D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-19", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-01-23", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Subcommittee #3", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-02-06", "action": "Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 6-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-02-13", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 18102, "person_hash": "hh89iwxo", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Michael Mullin", "first_name": "Michael", "middle_name": "P.", "last_name": "Mullin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-093", "ftm_eid": 42052805, "votesmart_id": 124102, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 604039, "ballotpedia": "Michael_Mullin", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1693697, "date": "2018-01-19", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB1528/id/1693697", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+HB1528+hil", "text_size": 18997, "text_hash": "c95d030ec75669e334ec08ccd31e661c"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 696148, "date": "2018-02-06", "desc": "House: Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 6-N)", "yea": 3, "nay": 6, "nv": 1, "absent": 0, "total": 10, "passed": 0, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB1528/id/696148", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+H1403V0033+HB1528"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-02-06", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Committee Room", "description": "House Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee #3 Committee Hearing"}]}}
