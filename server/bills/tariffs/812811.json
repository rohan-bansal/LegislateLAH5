Directs the State Corporation Commission to establish a program for eligible energy balancing customers, which are commercial or industrial customers that own an energy balancing device that provides value to the electric utility or regional transmission entity in the form of spinning reserve, frequency regulation, distribution system support, reactive power, demand response, or other electric grid services. An energy balancing device means either a grid-integrated electric vehicle or an electric battery that absorbs and returns energy to the electric grid on either a second-to-second response basis that provides frequency regulation or on a longer-term daily response basis that returns that energy to the electric grid during peak periods of demand. An energy balancing device does not add net electricity to the grid over a net metering period. An eligible energy balancing customer will be credited for the electricity it adds to the grid at the rate charged for the customer's usage of electricity. The aggregate statewide capacity of energy balancing devices is limited to 25 megawatts. The measure also directs the State Corporation Commission to conduct a study of the effectiveness of, and benefits achieved from, the deployment of energy balancing devices. A report on the study's findings and recommendations is due by December 1, 2018. The measure sunsets on July 1, 2019.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2016-01-13", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-01-13", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/16 16103826D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-01-13", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-01-19", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Special Subcommittee on Energy", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-16", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 752, "person_hash": "yiy1yv4b", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "David Toscano", "first_name": "David", "middle_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Toscano", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-057", "ftm_eid": 6080201, "votesmart_id": 58649, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 241249, "ballotpedia": "David_Toscano", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 734, "person_hash": "tjtqeuou", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Kenneth Plum", "first_name": "Kenneth", "middle_name": "R.", "last_name": "Plum", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-036", "ftm_eid": 5752216, "votesmart_id": 5181, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199458, "ballotpedia": "Ken_Plum", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1292969, "date": "2016-01-13", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB1137/id/1292969", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+HB1137+hil", "text_size": 22907, "text_hash": "b1320fd2bd6aab1cf40846c54b0b9aa1"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2016-02-09", "time": "00:00", "location": "GAB House Room D", "description": "House Commerce and Labor - Special Subcommittee on Energy Committee Hearing"}]}}
