Conditions such designation upon eligibility requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Trade Act of 1974. Prescribes the rule of origin for the articles for the duty-free treatment. Applies duty-free treatment, without any quantitative limitations, granted to textile and apparel articles under AGOA to articles imported directly into the U.S. customs territory from a beneficiary TRADE Act of 2009 country if their assembly meet specified U.S. origin requirements. Grants AGOA preferential treatment for apparel articles assembled in one or more beneficiary TRADE Act of 2009 countries or such former countries, or both, from regional fabric from yarn originating either in the United States or one or more of such countries.  Establishes: (1) limitations on such preferential treatment; and (2) special rules for apparel articles wholly assembled in one or more beneficiary TRADE Act of 2009 countries or former beneficiary countries, or both, regardless of the country of origin of the yarn or fabric used to make such articles; and (3) applicable percentages of such benefits.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2009-05-21", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2009-05-21", "action": "Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
