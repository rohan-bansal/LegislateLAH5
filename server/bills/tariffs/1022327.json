Commerce shall review an application for assistance submitted by a small firm based on the firm's ability-to-pay and its economic impact in its local community. The amount of such assistance is capped. The bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to modify criteria for determining industry support for petitions in countervailing and antidumping duties investigations. A U.S. business enterprise may file a petition with the Senate Committee on Finance or the House Committee on Ways and Means to determine whether or not a foreign country has violated its obligations under any trade agreement to which the United States is a party.
