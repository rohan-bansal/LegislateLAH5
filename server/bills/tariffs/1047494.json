Directs the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy to track the amount of net metered generation as a proportion of each electric distribution company's adjusted Virginia peak-load forecast for the previous year. The Department is required to make such information publicly available on its website. The measure requires the State Corporation Commission, when the generating capacity of net energy metering program participants reaches one percent of each electric distribution company's adjusted Virginia peak-load forecast for the previous year, to undertake a study of the value of solar energy to the grid, utilities, and the public. Upon completing the study, the Commission is directed to make recommendations to the General Assembly as to what changes, if any, should be made to the net energy metering program. The measure also repeals the existing requirement that the net metering standard contract or tariff shall be available to eligible customer-generators or eligible agricultural customer-generators on a first-come, first-served basis in each electric distribution company's Virginia service area until the one percent cap is met.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-05", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2018-01-23", "committee_id": 3860, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Subcommittee #3"}, {"date": "2018-02-13", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-05", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/10/18 18101859D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-05", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-01-23", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Subcommittee #3", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-30", "action": "Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (4-Y 5-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-02-13", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 1471, "person_hash": "z81xcdd3", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Mark Keam", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "Keam", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-035", "ftm_eid": 1359222, "votesmart_id": 111170, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 282951, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Keam", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1675256, "date": "2018-01-05", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB393/id/1675256", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+HB393+hil", "text_size": 15417, "text_hash": "13fc0b04ba1e3d8bdb96c0c4f6bed9c0"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 690700, "date": "2018-01-30", "desc": "House: Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (4-Y 5-N)", "yea": 4, "nay": 5, "nv": 1, "absent": 0, "total": 10, "passed": 0, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB393/id/690700", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+H1403V0018+HB0393"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-01-30", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Committee Room", "description": "House Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee #3 Committee Hearing"}]}}
