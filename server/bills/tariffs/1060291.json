Reduces the amount of the demand of an investor-owned electric utility's customer that makes the customer eligible to purchase electric power from any licensed supplier from five megawatts to one megawatt. The measure shortens the period that a utility's customer who switches from an investor-owned electric utility to a competing supplier is barred from returning as a customer of its utility from five years to three months. The measure revises the methodology for calculating certain costs for customers of an investor-owned electric utility that receive an exemption from the lock-out period. The measure (i) allows customers of an investor-owned electric utility to purchase 100 percent renewable energy from any licensed supplier and (ii) eliminates the condition that permits such purchases only if the incumbent investor-owned electric utility does not offer a tariff for 100 percent renewable energy. The measure does not change the existing corresponding requirements applicable to cooperative electric utilities.", "pending_committee_id": 161, "committee": {"committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-15", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-15", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 18103957D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-15", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-02-05", "action": "Continued to 2019 in Commerce and Labor (12-Y 2-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17821, "person_hash": "h7red5dv", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "David Suetterlein", "first_name": "David", "middle_name": "R.", "last_name": "Suetterlein", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-019", "ftm_eid": 31990949, "votesmart_id": 156664, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 346385, "ballotpedia": "David_Suetterlein", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1688465, "date": "2018-01-15", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB837/id/1688465", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+SB837+hil", "text_size": 19019, "text_hash": "be835a1521c258dfa6a438fffc7df3f4"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 694911, "date": "2018-02-05", "desc": "Senate: Continued to 2019 in Commerce and Labor (12-Y 2-N)", "yea": 12, "nay": 2, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB837/id/694911", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+S02V0078+SB0837"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-02-05", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}]}}
