Exempts generators that are not organized as a public service company and that provide electric energy from renewable energy to retail customers under certain power purchase agreements from being defined as a public utility or a supplier. The measure authorizes retail customers to purchase electric energy from such generators provided that the renewable energy electricity generation source is located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the retail customer or any affiliated person. The net energy metering programs are amended to remove the one percent cap relative to total utility sales for net metered facilities. The State Corporation Commission is directed to establish separate net energy metering programs for eligible multi-meter customer-generators, who are customers that own or operate, or contracts with another person to own or operate, or both, a renewable energy generating facility that uses as its sole energy source solar power, wind power, or aerobic or anaerobic digester gas, does not have an aggregate generation capacity of more than one megawatt, and is used primarily to provide energy to metered accounts of the customer. The measure amends the Commonwealth's energy policy by adding the goals of encouraging private sector distributed renewable energy, increasing security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects, and augmenting the exercise of private property rights by landowners desiring to generate their own energy from renewable energy sources on their lands.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2016-01-20", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-01-20", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 16103518D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-01-20", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-01-26", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Special Subcommittee on Energy", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-09", "action": "Subcommittee recommends continuing to 2017 by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-02-11", "action": "Continued to 2017 in Commerce and Labor by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 13733, "person_hash": "m3jknsvq", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Randall Minchew", "first_name": "J.
