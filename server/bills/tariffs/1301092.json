Replaces the voluntary renewable energy portfolio standard program with a mandatory clean energy standard (CES) program that sets requirements for all investor-owned electric utilities and cooperative electric utilities. The CES program requires 30 percent of the total electric energy sold by each utility in 2030 to be clean energy, which is defined as electricity generated without emitting carbon dioxide or generated by a natural gas-fired facility with 80 percent carbon capture or a coal-fired facility with 90 percent carbon capture. The CES Goals increase incrementally in future years until 2050 and thereafter, by which time 100 percent of the electric energy sold is required to be clean energy. The measure requires a utility that fails to meet a CES Goal to pay a compliance payment. The measure also requires each electric utility (i) to include a clean energy plan in each of its integrated resource plans and (ii) by January 1, 2030, to decommission all of its coal-fired electric generation facilities.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2020-01-08", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2020-01-23", "committee_id": 4167, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Energy"}], "history": [{"date": "2020-01-08", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/08/20 20104098D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-01-08", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2020-01-23", "action": "Assigned C&L sub: Energy", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-02-03", "action": "Incorporated by Commerce and Labor ", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 712, "person_hash": "ruiwcr21", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Dave Marsden", "first_name": "Dave", "middle_name": "W.", "last_name": "Marsden", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-037", "ftm_eid": 6467010, "votesmart_id": 58666, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 241244, "ballotpedia": "Dave_Marsden", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2089832, "date": "2020-01-08", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB876/id/2089832", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+SB876+hil", "text_size": 138196, "text_hash": "775dfd23ff68297e90c3895ee2f4f65f"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 913665, "date": "2020-02-03", "desc": "Senate: Incorporated by Commerce and Labor ", "yea": 13, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 13, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB876/id/913665", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+vot+S02V0085+SB0876"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2020-01-27", "time": "00:00", "location": "Senate Room A", "description": "Senate Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee Energy Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2020-01-29", "time": "08:00", "location": "Senate Room A", "description": "Senate Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee Energy Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2020-01-29", "time": "08:00", "location": "Senate Room A Updated to add SB 992", "description": "Senate Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee Energy Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2020-02-03", "time": "00:00", "location": "Senate Room A, Pocahontas Building", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}]}}
