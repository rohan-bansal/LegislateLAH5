Directs that the requirement that electric utilities give customers 10 days' notice by mail prior to terminating service applies regardless of whether reasonable cause exists to believe the customer is receiving utility services without paying or that the utility's equipment has been damaged or tampered with to prevent the meter from recording usage. The measure provides that the requirement that a utility give 10 days' notice by mail prior to terminating service does not apply if (i) the condition of a customer's wiring, equipment, or appliances is either unsafe or unsuitable for receiving the utility service; (ii) the customer's use of the utility service or equipment interferes with or may be detrimental to the utility's facilities or to the provision of utility service by the utility to any other customer; or (iii) electric service is furnished over a line that is not owned or leased by the utility and the line is either not in a safe and suitable condition or is inadequate to receive electric utility service. The measure authorizes a customer to petition the State Corporation Commission for a review of an electric utility's determination that it is authorized to terminate the customer's electric service. The measure requires the 10-day termination notice to include a description of the customer's ability to petition the Commission for a review of the electric utility's determination.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-01-09", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2019-01-15", "committee_id": 3860, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Subcommittee #3"}, {"date": "2019-02-05", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-01-09", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/09/19 19104145D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-01-09", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2019-01-15", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Subcommittee #3", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-01-24", "action": "Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (7-Y 2-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-02-05", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 19508, "person_hash": "xah7b7am", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Kathy Tran", "first_name": "Kathy", "middle_name": "K.L.", "last_name": "Tran", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-042", "ftm_eid": 43620471, "votesmart_id": 176359, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 403178, "ballotpedia": "Kathy_Tran", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1840777, "date": "2019-01-09", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2537/id/1840777", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2537+hil", "text_size": 6103, "text_hash": "9b49c95f7603371a36021f1b7cbef4db"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 785893, "date": "2019-01-24", "desc": "House: Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (7-Y 2-N)", "yea": 7, "nay": 2, "nv": 2, "absent": 0, "total": 11, "passed": 1, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB2537/id/785893", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+vot+H1403V0016+HB2537"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2019-01-24", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Committee Room", "description": "House Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee #3 Committee Hearing"}]}}
