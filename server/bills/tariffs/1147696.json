Exempts sellers under third-party power purchase agreements from being defined as a public utility, public service corporation, public service company, or electric utility solely because of the sale of electricity or ownership or operation of a distributed generation facility. The measure provides that the sale of electricity generated at a distributed energy facility by a person that is not a public utility, public service corporation, or public service company to a customer that is purchasing or leasing the distributed energy facility under the terms of a third-party power purchase agreement does not constitute the retail sale of electricity. The measure proscribes State Corporation Commission regulation of the sale of electric energy that is generated on site by a distributed generation facility pursuant to a third-party power purchase agreement. The measure also repeals the pilot program initially enacted in 2013 that authorized Dominion Energy to enter into certain third-party power purchase agreements providing financing of certain renewable generation facilities.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-01-10", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2019-01-15", "committee_id": 3860, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Subcommittee #3"}, {"date": "2019-02-05", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-01-10", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 19103068D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-01-10", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2019-01-15", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Subcommittee #3", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-01-24", "action": "Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 6-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-02-05", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 19470, "person_hash": "4ikqyjkc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Wendy Gooditis", "first_name": "Wendy", "middle_name": "W.", "last_name": "Gooditis", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-010", "ftm_eid": 43970626, "votesmart_id": 176543, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 621354, "ballotpedia": "Wendy_Gooditis", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1845482, "date": "2019-01-10", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2641/id/1845482", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2641+hil", "text_size": 23248, "text_hash": "862ed0f8a3775cee1d125e43edff2990"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 785868, "date": "2019-01-24", "desc": "House: Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 6-N)", "yea": 3, "nay": 6, "nv": 2, "absent": 0, "total": 11, "passed": 0, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB2641/id/785868", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+vot+H1403V0019+HB2641"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2019-01-24", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Committee Room", "description": "House Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee #3 Committee Hearing"}]}}
