Dumping and countervailable subsidies are unfair trade practices that cause (or threaten to cause) material injury to U.S. industries by importing products (1) that are similar to those sold in the U.S market at less than fair value (dumping), or (2) with the assistance of subsidies from a foreign government or public entity (countervailable duties). Specifically, the task force shall identify (1) potential countervailable subsidies and dumping that may be causing (or threatening to cause) material injury to an industry in the United States, and (2) potential circumvention of existing antidumping or countervailing duty orders.
