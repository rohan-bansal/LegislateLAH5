Requires the State Corporation Commission to establish a program of community net metering, which will allow a group of residential, commercial, industrial, and other customers to establish an \"eligible community customer\" to act collectively to generate renewable energy for their own use. Members of an eligible community customer may develop a net metered system that provides that excess generation by some members of the group will be used to offset consumption by other members within the group. The generating capacity of an eligible community customer's facility shall not exceed two megawatts at a single site. If electricity generated by the generation facility or facilities within the eligible community customer group in a year exceeds the net electricity consumption by members of the group, the utility shall reduce the eligible community customer's bill for the next monthly billing period by the amount of the excess. An eligible community customer will be exempt from the requirement that he install two-way metering equipment if the electrical generating system from which the eligible community customer obtains electricity is not physically attached to or an integral part of the building or structure where he consumes electricity, provided metering equipment measures the excess electricity from the generation facility. The measure also requires the Commission to establish a process for issuing or recognizing renewable energy certificates. The process will provide for the issuance, monitoring, transferring, and use of renewable energy certificates.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2012-01-11", "action": "House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/12 12103616D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-11", "action": "House: Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2012-01-17", "action": "House: Assigned C & L sub: Special Subcommittee on Energy", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-26", "action": "House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table by voice vote", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-02-14", "action": "House: Left in Commerce and Labor (0-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 13733, "person_hash": "m3jknsvq", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Randall Minchew", "first_name": "J.
