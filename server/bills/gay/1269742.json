Further, insurance plans must not impose any preauthorization requirement for this coverage. These coverage requirements also apply to public health insurance programs, including, among others, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Additionally, the bill prohibits denying, limiting, or qualifying coverage or increasing premiums for disability insurance, long-term care insurance, or life insurance policies based on a person taking medication for HIV prevention. The bill further requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to states, or directly to eligible local organizations, to provide uninsured individuals access to prescription drugs and related services that prevent HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also must develop a public awareness campaign that focuses efforts in communities with a high need for HIV prevention treatment.", "pending_committee_id": 2328, "committee": {"committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-06-20", "committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-06-20", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 18412, "person_hash": "nxsqmyve", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Kamala Harris", "first_name": "Kamala", "middle_name": "D.", "last_name": "Harris", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CA", "ftm_eid": 21642, "votesmart_id": 120012, "opensecrets_id": "N00036915", "knowwho_pid": 314474, "ballotpedia": "Kamala_Harris", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "HB3815", "sast_bill_id": 1271635}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB1643", "sast_bill_id": 1236572}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13304, "subject_name": "Health"}, {"subject_id": 13142, "subject_name": "Child health"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13198, "subject_name": "Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 13605, "subject_name": "HIV/AIDS"}, {"subject_id": 13206, "subject_name": "Health care costs and insurance"}, {"subject_id": 13207, "subject_name": "Health care coverage and access"}, {"subject_id": 13213, "subject_name": "Health promotion and preventive care"}, {"subject_id": 13228, "subject_name": "Indian social and development programs"}, {"subject_id": 13487, "subject_name": "Insurance industry and regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13239, "subject_name": "Medicaid"}, {"subject_id": 13242, "subject_name": "Medicare"}, {"subject_id": 13245, "subject_name": "Minority health"}, {"subject_id": 13490, "subject_name": "Prescription drugs"}, {"subject_id": 13295, "subject_name": "Veterans' medical care"}, {"subject_id": 13302, "subject_name": "Women's health"}, {"subject_id": 13323, "subject_name": "Disability and health-based discrimination"}, {"subject_id": 13622, "subject_name": "Family planning and birth control"}, {"subject_id": 13209, "subject_name": "Health facilities and institutions"}, {"subject_id": 13212, "subject_name": "Health programs administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13653, "subject_name": "Life, casualty, property insurance"}, {"subject_id": 13237, "subject_name": "Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"}, {"subject_id": 13313, "subject_name": "Medical tests and diagnostic methods"}, {"subject_id": 13272, "subject_name": "Rural conditions and development"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2043659, "date": "2019-06-26", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1926/id/2043659", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s1926/BILLS-116s1926is.pdf", "text_size": 404121, "text_hash": "7ff6fd677e0d8fadb5140b1d342c9647"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
