The bill requires the State Department to report certain data regarding the diversity of its workforce; conduct interviews with current employees, and exit interviews with separating employees, to receive feedback on workplace policies, professional development opportunities, and other issues affecting diversity; expand anti-harassment, antidiscrimination, and implicit bias training and make such training mandatory for certain individuals; develop a pilot program to use gender-neutral terms in evaluation forms; review employee terminations to determine wrongful terminations based on sexual orientation and issue a report on the findings; establish a Reconciliation Board to contact an employee (or family member) improperly terminated during the Lavender Scare and offer to change the employee's record; establish a board to address issues faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex Foreign Service employees and their families; and report on which countries refuse to issue spousal visas for Foreign Service employee spouses due to sexual orientation and recommend how to address this issue.", "pending_committee_id": 2327, "committee": {"committee_id": 2327, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Foreign Relations"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2020-03-10", "committee_id": 2327, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Foreign Relations"}], "history": [{"date": "2020-03-10", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9413, "person_hash": "fpzplzoq", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Robert Menendez", "first_name": "Robert", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Menendez", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-NJ", "ftm_eid": 17659015, "votesmart_id": 26961, "opensecrets_id": "N00000699", "knowwho_pid": 158964, "ballotpedia": "Bob_Menendez", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB1252", "sast_bill_id": 1255620}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13422, "subject_name": "International affairs"}, {"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13161, "subject_name": "Department of State"}, {"subject_id": 13430, "subject_name": "Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"}, {"subject_id": 20685, "subject_name": "Employee hiring"}, {"subject_id": 13176, "subject_name": "Employment and training programs"}, {"subject_id": 13177, "subject_name": "Employment discrimination and employee rights"}, {"subject_id": 13184, "subject_name": "Executive agency funding and structure"}, {"subject_id": 13737, "subject_name": "Federal officials"}, {"subject_id": 13198, "subject_name": "Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13215, "subject_name": "Higher education"}, {"subject_id": 13488, "subject_name": "Marriage and family status"}, {"subject_id": 13484, "subject_name": "Military personnel and dependents"}, {"subject_id": 20700, "subject_name": "Minority employment"}, {"subject_id": 13560, "subject_name": "Museums, exhibitions, cultural centers"}, {"subject_id": 13326, "subject_name": "Sex, gender, sexual orientation discrimination"}, {"subject_id": 13286, "subject_name": "Student aid and college costs"}, {"subject_id": 13294, "subject_name": "Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"}, {"subject_id": 13527, "subject_name": "Visas and passports"}, {"subject_id": 13327, "subject_name": "Women's employment"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2173940, "date": "2020-03-18", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB3430/id/2173940", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3430/BILLS-116s3430is.pdf", "text_size": 363865, "text_hash": "776871f1793feafff79c1ee70317a938"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
