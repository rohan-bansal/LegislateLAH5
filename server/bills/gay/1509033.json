There are many overlapping areas of practice between geologists and well-drillers and registered professional engineers. However, the exemption included in 24 Del. C. \u00a7 3602 leads to the conclusion that a licensed well driller or registered professional engineer is qualified to perform any act within the practice of geology regardless of level of competence or expertise. It is each governing bodys responsibility to ensure competent practice within the respective professions, including any areas of overlap. However, the inclusion of the very broad exemption for well-drillers and registered professional engineers is misleading and does not serve the interests of public protection.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2021-05-13", "committee_id": 4337, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 26, "name": "Legislative Oversight & Sunset"}, {"date": "2021-05-27", "committee_id": 1699, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Sunset Committee (Policy Analysis & Government Accountability)"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-05-13", "action": "Introduced and Assigned to Legislative Oversight & Sunset Committee in Senate", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-05-19", "action": "Reported Out of Committee (Legislative Oversight & Sunset) in Senate with 1 Favorable, 2 On Its Merits", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-05-20", "action": "Passed By Senate.
