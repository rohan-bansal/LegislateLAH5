Requires the state board to establish interim targets for reductions in the greenhouse gas intensity of cement used within the state relative to the average greenhouse gas intensity of cement used within the state during the 2019 calendar year, to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of cement used within the state to 40 percent below the 2019 average levels by December 31, 2035 (Sec. 2). Establishes that by July 1, 2028, the state board shall evaluate the feasibility of achieving the interim targets established and may adjust the interim targets upward or downward to reflect technological advancements and progress in addressing barriers to the deployment of greenhouse gas emissions reduction technologies and processes, including those barriers for which measures have been identified (Sec. 2). Requires the state board to do all of the following (Sec. 2): Define a metric for greenhouse gas intensity and evaluate the data submitted by cement manufacturing plants to the state board for the 2019 calendar year and other relevant data about emissions of greenhouse gases for cement that was imported into the state to establish a baseline from which to measure greenhouse gas intensity reductions; Assess the effectiveness of existing measures, identify any modifications to existing measures, and evaluate new measures to overcome the market, statutory, and regulatory barriers inhibiting achievement of the objectives described in this section; Identify actions that reduce adverse air quality impacts and support economic and workforce development in communities neighboring cement plants; and Include provisions to minimize and mitigate potential leakage and account for embedded emissions of greenhouse gases in imported cement similarly to emissions of greenhouse gases for cement produced in the state, such as through a border carbon adjustment mechanism."}
