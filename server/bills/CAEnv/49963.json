Authorizes a groundwater sustainability agency to perform certain actions, including, but not limited to, the following actions (Sec. 3): Require all groundwater extraction facilities within its authority to use a water-measuring device; Regulate groundwater extraction, including, but not limited to, limiting extraction from individual wells and the construction of new wells; and Acquire property in order to implement a groundwater sustainability plan, including, but not limited to, the following property: Land; Water rights; Buildings; and Easements. Requires a groundwater sustainability plan to include certain components as applicable to each basin, including, but not limited to, the following components (Sec. 3): The monitoring and management of groundwater levels and quality; The mitigation of overdraft; The control of saline water intrusion; and A well abandonment and destruction program. Requires the Department of Water Resources to categorize each basin as high, medium, low, or very low priority by January 31, 2015 (Sec. 3). Requires all high or medium-priority basins to be managed by a groundwater sustainability plan by January 31, 2020, and all other priority basins to be managed under a plan by January 31, 2022 (Sec. 3). Specifies that a local agency has 2 years to establish a groundwater sustainability agency or an authorized alternative for a basin that is categorized as medium or high priority after January 31, 2015, and 5 years to adopt a groundwater sustainability plan (Sec. 3). Prohibits the adoption or renewal of any groundwater management plan other than a groundwater sustainability plan after January 1, 2015 (Sec. 4). Requires the department to manage the monitoring of groundwater in basins that are not being appropriately monitored and where there is “insufficient interest” by a local agency to establish a groundwater plan (Sec. 6). Specifies that this bill shall only become effective if both Assembly Bill 1739 and Senate Bill 1319 of the 2013-2014 Regular Session are enacted and become effective (Sec. 10)."}
