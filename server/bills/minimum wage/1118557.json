In provisions concerning the child care assistance program, requires the Department of Human Services to provide child care services to parents or other relatives who are engaged in a good-faith job search for a period of up to 6 months. Deletes certain provisions regarding eligibility of certain families eligible for child care assistance and factors for determining assistance. Adds language providing that no family shall be excluded from eligibility for child care benefits based solely on household income and that the amount of child care assistance shall (i) take into account the amount families can afford to pay based on the co-payment scale established by the Department and (ii) cover the cost of quality child care. Contains provisions limiting redeterminations to once every 12 months. Removes provisions authorizing the Department to lower income eligibility ceilings, raise parent co-payments, create waiting lists, or take such other actions during a fiscal year as are necessary to ensure that child care benefits paid under the Code do not exceed the amounts appropriated for those child care benefits. Contains provisions requiring the Department to: (1) establish a wage scale sufficient to recruit and retain a skilled and diverse child care workforce; (2) annually publish in draft form its determination of the cost of quality care; (3) adopt policies that maximize the participation of eligible children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs; and (4) submit annual reports to the General Assembly concerning certain matters.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2018-05-16", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-05-16", "action": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
