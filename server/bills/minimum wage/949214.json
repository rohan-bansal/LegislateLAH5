Provides that a rate is excessive if it is likely to produce a long run profit that is unreasonably high for the insurance provided or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to the services rendered (instead of providing that a rate in a competitive market is not excessive and a rate in a noncompetitive market is excessive if it is likely to produce a long run profit that is unreasonably high for the insurance provided or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to the services rendered). Provides for prefiling (rather than filing) of rates with the Director of Insurance and makes other changes regarding rate filings and disapproval of rate filings. Contains provisions concerning interim rates. Repeals provisions regarding presumptions and determinations on whether a competitive market exists and the disapproval of rates under specified circumstances. Amends the Workers' Compensation Act. Provides that accidental injuries sustained while traveling to or from work do not arise out of and in the course of employment. Provides specific factors that may be considered when determining whether an employee was required to travel away from work. Contains provisions concerning safety programs and return to work programs; compensation awards for injuries to the shoulder and hip; repetitive and cumulative injuries; additional compensation awards in cases where there has been an unreasonable or vexatious delay of authorization of medical treatment; new penalties for workers' compensation fraud; annual reports on the state of self-insurance for workers' compensation in Illinois; the Workers' Compensation Premium Rates Task Force; and other matters.
