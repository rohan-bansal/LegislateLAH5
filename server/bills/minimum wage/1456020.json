Provides that a covenant not to solicit shall not be valid or enforceable unless the employee's actual or expected annualized rate of earnings exceeds $45,000 per year. Provides that a covenant not to compete is void and illegal for any employee who an employer terminates or furloughs as the result of business circumstances or governmental orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or under circumstances that are similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless enforcement of the covenant not to compete includes compensation equivalent to the employee's base salary at the time of termination for the period of enforcement minus compensation earned through subsequent employment during the period of enforcement. Contains provisions concerning the enforceability of a covenant not to compete or a covenant not to solicit; notice requirements for employers under a covenant not to compete or a covenant not to solicit; remedies for employees who prevail against an employer's civil action to enforce a covenant not to compete or a covenant not to solicit; and certain factors a court may consider when determining whether to reform a covenant not to compete or a covenant not to solicit.
