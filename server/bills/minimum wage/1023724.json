The bill makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee or non-employee who has filed a complaint with respect to their employment classification, and (2) wrongly classify an employee as a non-employee. The bill doubles the amount of liquidated damages for unpaid wages and misclassifications of employees. The bill amends the Social Security Act to: (1) require, as a condition for the federal grant program for unemployment compensation administration, auditing and investigative procedures to identify employers who are not registered under state law or who are paying unreported wages; and (2) impose administrative penalties for misclassification of employees or payment of unreported wages without proper recordkeeping. The bill requires the Department of Labor to report any misclassification of an employee to its Wage and Hour Division. The Wage and Hour Division is then authorized to report a misclassification to the Internal Revenue Service.", "pending_committee_id": 2301, "committee": {"committee_id": 2301, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education And The Workforce"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-07-28", "committee_id": 2301, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education And The Workforce"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-07-28", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-07-28", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-07-28", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11200, "person_hash": "zm3hjkaf", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Frederica Wilson", "first_name": "Frederica", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Wilson", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-FL-24", "ftm_eid": 12999016, "votesmart_id": 17319, "opensecrets_id": "N00030650", "knowwho_pid": 211856, "ballotpedia": "Frederica_Wilson", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB6189", "sast_bill_id": 1123120}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13160, "subject_name": "Department of Labor"}, {"subject_id": 13177, "subject_name": "Employment discrimination and employee rights"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13234, "subject_name": "Labor standards"}, {"subject_id": 13258, "subject_name": "Performance measurement"}, {"subject_id": 13888, "subject_name": "Personnel records"}, {"subject_id": 13319, "subject_name": "Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}, {"subject_id": 13293, "subject_name": "Unemployment"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13504, "subject_name": "Self-employed"}, {"subject_id": 13328, "subject_name": "Labor and employment"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1645217, "date": "2017-08-17", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB3629/id/1645217", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr3629/BILLS-115hr3629ih.pdf", "text_size": 279428, "text_hash": "b8f5d0e41c2edfba2f9a3851ce309c1c"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
