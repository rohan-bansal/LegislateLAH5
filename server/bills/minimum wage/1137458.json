The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat employers who make qualified wage subsidy payments to eligible Puerto Rico employees as having paid payroll taxes in an amount equal to the wage subsidy payment. An \"eligible Puerto Rico employee\" is any individual who (1) is a U.S. citizen, (2) has a Social Security number, and (3) certifies to the employer that he or she is a resident of Puerto Rico and intends to remain a resident for at least the next six months. A \"qualified wage subsidy payment\" is a payment equal to 50% of the excess (if any) of: (1) the median hourly wage for Puerto Rico ($10 for 2020 and 2021), over (2) the hourly wage paid to the eligible Puerto Rico employee.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-01-03", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-01-03", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11910, "person_hash": "8u29wj1z", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Marco Rubio", "first_name": "Marco", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Rubio", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-FL", "ftm_eid": 12999040, "votesmart_id": 1601, "opensecrets_id": "N00030612", "knowwho_pid": 193597, "ballotpedia": "Marco_Rubio", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13328, "subject_name": "Labor and employment"}, {"subject_id": 13489, "subject_name": "Caribbean area"}, {"subject_id": 13178, "subject_name": "Employment taxes"}, {"subject_id": 13234, "subject_name": "Labor standards"}, {"subject_id": 13263, "subject_name": "Puerto Rico"}, {"subject_id": 13319, "subject_name": "Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}, {"subject_id": 13491, "subject_name": "U.S. territories and protectorates"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1838044, "date": "2019-01-07", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB6/id/1838044", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s6/BILLS-116s6is.pdf", "text_size": 256790, "text_hash": "2b22cfb5797536ad6cd32fc89d969e01"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
