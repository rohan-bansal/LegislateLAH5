Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) discharge or otherwise discriminate against an individual (including an employee) who has opposed any practice, or filed a complaint or instituted any proceeding related to this Act, including with respect to an individual's status as an employee or non-employee; and (2) wrongly classify an employee as a non-employee. Doubles the amount of liquidated damages for maximum hours, minimum wage, and notice of classification violations by an employer. Subjects a person who: (1) violates such requirements (including recordkeeping requirements) to a civil penalty of up to $1,100; or (2) repeatedly or willfully violates such requirements to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a single Web page on the Department of Labor website that summarizes the rights of employees and non-employees under the FLSA and this Act. Amends the Social Security Act to require, as a condition for a federal grant for the administration of state unemployment compensation, for the state's unemployment compensation law to include a provision for: (1) auditing programs that identify employers that have not registered under the state law or that are paying unreported compensation where the effect is to exclude employees from unemployment compensation coverage, and (2) establishing administrative penalties for misclassifying employees or paying unreported unemployment compensation to employees.  Requires any office, administration, or division of the Department of Labor to report any misclassification of an employee by a person subject to the FLSA that it discovers to the Department's Wage and Hour Division (WHD). Authorizes the WHD to report such information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).", "pending_committee_id": 2328, "committee": {"committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2011-04-08", "committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}], "history": [{"date": "2011-04-08", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9402, "person_hash": "bsdo1kgr", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Sherrod Brown", "first_name": "Sherrod", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Brown", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OH", "ftm_eid": 3439679, "votesmart_id": 27018, "opensecrets_id": "N00003535", "knowwho_pid": 159013, "ballotpedia": "Sherrod_Brown", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 11199, "person_hash": "crmbr7rg", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Richard Blumenthal", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Blumenthal", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CT", "ftm_eid": 6378136, "votesmart_id": 1568, "opensecrets_id": "N00031685", "knowwho_pid": 218586, "ballotpedia": "Richard_Blumenthal", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9476, "person_hash": "3us9m996", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Al Franken", "first_name": "Al", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Franken", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-MN", "ftm_eid": 1646379, "votesmart_id": 108924, "opensecrets_id": "N00029016", "knowwho_pid": 266864, "ballotpedia": "Al_Franken", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9419, "person_hash": "75ev2noc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Tom Harkin", "first_name": "Tom", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Harkin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-IA", "ftm_eid": 0, "votesmart_id": 53294, "opensecrets_id": "N00004207", "knowwho_pid": 165216, "ballotpedia": "Tom_Harkin", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB3178", "sast_bill_id": 342410}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13160, "subject_name": "Department of Labor"}, {"subject_id": 13177, "subject_name": "Employment discrimination and employee rights"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 13234, "subject_name": "Labor standards"}, {"subject_id": 13258, "subject_name": "Performance measurement"}, {"subject_id": 13888, "subject_name": "Personnel records"}, {"subject_id": 13319, "subject_name": "Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}, {"subject_id": 13293, "subject_name": "Unemployment"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13328, "subject_name": "Labor and employment"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 257851, "date": "2011-04-12", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB770/id/257851", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/s770/BILLS-112s770is.pdf", "text_size": 183131, "text_hash": "82cd655c7ee0238c4b9f34d21cd8a79a"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
