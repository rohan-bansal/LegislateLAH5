Provides that if the court determines that the defendant is unable to pay the assessment, the court may reduce the assessment or waive the assessment in the court's discretion. Provides that one hour of public or community service shall be equivalent to the value of one hour of work at the State minimum wage or the minimum hourly wage in the municipality where the defendant resides, whichever is greater, as calculated by the Department of Labor (rather than one hour of public or community service being equivalent to $4 of assessment). Provides that on the effective date of the Act and annually thereafter, the Director of Labor shall publish the Illinois minimum wage and the minimum wages of each municipality in the State that has enacted a minimum wage that is greater than the State minimum wage. Provides that the Director of Labor shall update the list if the State or municipal minimum wage is changed by law or if a municipality enacts an ordinance increasing its minimum wage that is greater than the State minimum wage. Provides that the published minimum wage list and updates shall be sent to the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts to be provided to each judicial circuit in the State.", "pending_committee_id": 235, "committee": {"committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-10-17", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-09-19", "action": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
