Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the federal minimum wage to at least the amount determined by the Secretary of Labor according to the formula prescribed by this Act beginning September 1, 2012. Requires the Secretary to determine such minimum wage rate by June 1, 2012, and once every four years thereafter. Prohibits any adjustment if the determination would result in a minimum wage lower than the current one. Requires the minimum wage so determined to be the minimum hourly wage sufficient for a person working for it 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, to earn an annual income 15% percent higher than the federal poverty threshold for a two-person household, with one child under age 18, and living in the 48 contiguous states, as published for each such year by the Census Bureau.", "pending_committee_id": 2548, "committee": {"committee_id": 2548, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Workforce Protections"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2012-06-29", "committee_id": 2301, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education And The Workforce"}, {"date": "2012-09-26", "committee_id": 2548, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Workforce Protections"}], "history": [{"date": "2012-06-29", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2012-09-26", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9050, "person_hash": "mk25m4b8", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Al Green", "first_name": "Al", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Green", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-TX-9", "ftm_eid": 11567524, "votesmart_id": 49680, "opensecrets_id": "N00026686", "knowwho_pid": 226547, "ballotpedia": "Al_Green_(Texas)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB283", "sast_bill_id": 227157}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13220, "subject_name": "Housing finance and home ownership"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13328, "subject_name": "Labor and employment"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 658727, "date": "2012-07-07", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB6076/id/658727", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/hr6076/BILLS-112hr6076ih.pdf", "text_size": 252068, "text_hash": "6798d2ca1f94397a4349e5b97b378b17"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
