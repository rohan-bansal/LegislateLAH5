The program shall consist of both national systems of competitive bidding and grants of specified amounts to states. An area with low-tier service is an area where at least 90% of the population has access to broadband service with speeds between 25-100 megabits per second (mbps). An area with mid-tier service is an area where at least 90% of the population has access to broadband service with speeds between 100 mbps and 1 gigabit per second.
