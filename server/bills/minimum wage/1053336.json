Removes the exemptions that exclude newsboys, shoe shine boys, ushers, doormen, concession attendants, and theater cashiers from the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (Act). The Act's exclusion for babysitters is limited to those not employed more than 10 hours per week. The spouse, children, and parents of an individual employer are excluded from the definition of \"employee\" under the Act. The measure eliminates the Act's exclusion for persons employed by an employer that does not have four or more employees. The measure requires a court to award attorney fees incurred by an employee who is awarded judgment in an action for a violation of the Act; currently, awarding such fees is permitted but not required. The measure expands the information an employer is required to provide to its employees when wages are paid. Finally, the bill authorizes the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to institute proceedings and take enforcement action against an employer if he has reason to believe that the employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of violations.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-10", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-10", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/10/18 18100922D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-10", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-02-07", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (7-Y 6-N 1-A)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 797, "person_hash": "a5rvr70t", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Frank Wagner", "first_name": "Frank", "middle_name": "W.", "last_name": "Wagner", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-007", "ftm_eid": 6270516, "votesmart_id": 5199, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199443, "ballotpedia": "Frank_Wagner", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 683, "person_hash": "gm46wrfb", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Adam Ebbin", "first_name": "Adam", "middle_name": "P.", "last_name": "Ebbin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-030", "ftm_eid": 6410921, "votesmart_id": 50868, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 221587, "ballotpedia": "Adam_Ebbin", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1681257, "date": "2018-01-10", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB661/id/1681257", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+SB661+hil", "text_size": 14586, "text_hash": "1666221fc9a03b13caffd035e0107907"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 696521, "date": "2018-02-07", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (7-Y 6-N 1-A)", "yea": 7, "nay": 6, "nv": 0, "absent": 1, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB661/id/696521", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+S02V0116+SB0661"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-01-29", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-02-07", "time": "00:00", "location": "Senate Com Room A, Pocahontas Bldg", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}]}}
