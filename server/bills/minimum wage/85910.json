Provides that: eligible economically distressed workers enrolled or participating in economically distressed worker training may not be denied unemployment insurance benefits solely because they are attending training; eligible economically distressed workers approved for economically distressed worker training may not be denied unemployment insurance benefits for refusing to accept work, subject to certain conditions; and eligible economically distressed workers who are enrolled or participating in economically distressed worker training and who are otherwise eligible for unemployment insurance benefits are not ineligible for benefits or waiting week credit because of attendance in the training. Sets forth duties of the Director of Employment Security and contains provisions regarding rules and a report. Provides that a base period employer's account may not be charged for benefits for economically distressed worker training paid under this Section, but this does not relieve the State, reimbursing political subdivisions, or reimbursing nonprofit employers from paying into the unemployment trust fund account an amount equal to the benefits for economically distressed worker training paid under the new provisions.
