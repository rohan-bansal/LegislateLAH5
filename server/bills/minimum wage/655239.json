Allows the use of grants to issue forgivable loans to entities that employ not fewer than 50 full-time employees in high-value jobs and that are deciding whether to locate in rural and distressed areas.  Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) grant business taxpayers a tax credit for up to 20% of insourcing expenses incurred for eliminating a business located outside the United States and relocating it within the United States, and (2) deny a tax deduction for outsourcing expenses incurred in relocating a U.S. business outside the United States. Requires an increase in the taxpayer's employment of full-time employees in the United States in order to claim the tax credit for insourcing expenses. Extends through 2017 the additional allowance for depreciation of business property (bonus depreciation) and the election to accelerate the alternative minimum tax credit in lieu of bonus depreciation. Makes permanent: (1) the increased $500,000 expensing allowance for depreciable business property and qualified real property, and (2) the new markets tax credit.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2014-07-29", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2014-07-29", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9470, "person_hash": "o6vdtziy", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mark Pryor", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "Pryor", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-AR", "ftm_eid": 0, "votesmart_id": 35, "opensecrets_id": "N00013823", "knowwho_pid": 211669, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Pryor", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 16220, "person_hash": "bznho579", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Walsh", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "E.", "last_name": "Walsh", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-MT", "ftm_eid": 10885290, "votesmart_id": 111027, "opensecrets_id": "N00035686", "knowwho_pid": 421796, "ballotpedia": "John_Walsh_(Montana)", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB851", "sast_bill_id": 519456}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB337", "sast_bill_id": 500094}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB2562", "sast_bill_id": 653857}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB2569", "sast_bill_id": 654207}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13510, "subject_name": "Accounting and auditing"}, {"subject_id": 13139, "subject_name": "Business investment and capital"}, {"subject_id": 13168, "subject_name": "Economic development"}, {"subject_id": 20685, "subject_name": "Employee hiring"}, {"subject_id": 13365, "subject_name": "Foreign and international corporations"}, {"subject_id": 13202, "subject_name": "Government lending and loan guarantees"}, {"subject_id": 13224, "subject_name": "Income tax credits"}, {"subject_id": 13225, "subject_name": "Income tax deductions"}, {"subject_id": 13493, "subject_name": "Inflation and prices"}, {"subject_id": 13586, "subject_name": "Lighting and heating"}, {"subject_id": 13259, "subject_name": "Poverty and welfare assistance"}, {"subject_id": 13272, "subject_name": "Rural conditions and development"}, {"subject_id": 13370, "subject_name": "Taxation of foreign income"}, {"subject_id": 13491, "subject_name": "U.S. territories and protectorates"}, {"subject_id": 13293, "subject_name": "Unemployment"}, {"subject_id": 13338, "subject_name": "Taxation"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1041510, "date": "2014-08-05", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB2681/id/1041510", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/s2681/BILLS-113s2681is.pdf", "text_size": 292859, "text_hash": "99320b2e60f4912f356c2423c2b43222"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
