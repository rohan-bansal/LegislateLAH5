The bill eliminates a statutory provision calling for the 50% rule, which requires an H-2A employer to hire any qualified U.S. applicants until half of the time period on an H-2A worker's contract has elapsed. The bill also revises requirements for employer-provided housing or housing allowances for H-2A workers, including standards for such accommodations. The employer shall request an inspection to certify that the housing meets the required standards. An employer shall not be required to pay an H-2A worker more than 115% of the federal or applicable state minimum wage, whichever is higher. Aliens admitted as H-2A workers who overstay their visas are barred from the program for five years. Aliens admitted on the basis of fraud or who commit certain crimes are barred permanently. Employers who knowingly hire H-2A workers who overstay their visas or employers who engage in fraud or misrepresentation shall be barred from the program. The bill also prohibits the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) from providing legal assistance for an alien unless (1) the alien is present in the United States when the assistance is provided, and (2) the parties have attempted to mediate the dispute in good faith. An H-2A employer is not required to allow an entity receiving LSC funding to enter the employer's property without an appointment with a specific H-2A worker.", "pending_committee_id": 3994, "committee": {"committee_id": 3994, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-02-15", "committee_id": 2309, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Judiciary"}, {"date": "2021-04-28", "committee_id": 3994, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-02-15", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-02-15", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-04-28", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16447, "person_hash": "gvpp7oqw", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Rick Allen", "first_name": "Rick", "middle_name": "W.", "last_name": "Allen", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-GA-12", "ftm_eid": 6939101, "votesmart_id": 136062, "opensecrets_id": "N00032240", "knowwho_pid": 378450, "ballotpedia": "Rick_Allen", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13346, "subject_name": "Immigration"}, {"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13151, "subject_name": "Department of Agriculture"}, {"subject_id": 13157, "subject_name": "Department of Homeland Security"}, {"subject_id": 13160, "subject_name": "Department of Labor"}, {"subject_id": 13191, "subject_name": "Foreign labor"}, {"subject_id": 13309, "subject_name": "Fraud offenses and financial crimes"}, {"subject_id": 13220, "subject_name": "Housing finance and home ownership"}, {"subject_id": 13403, "subject_name": "Immigration status and procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13342, "subject_name": "Lawyers and legal services"}, {"subject_id": 13552, "subject_name": "Livestock"}, {"subject_id": 13899, "subject_name": "Migrant, seasonal, agricultural labor"}, {"subject_id": 13801, "subject_name": "Temporary and part-time employment"}, {"subject_id": 13527, "subject_name": "Visas and passports"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2336759, "date": "2021-03-15", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB1037/id/2336759", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr1037/BILLS-117hr1037ih.pdf", "text_size": 278728, "text_hash": "4b18bcaeeb6064a9d33921d83ea26d81"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
