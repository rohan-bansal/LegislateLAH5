Makes up to 55,000 (EB-6) visas, reduced by the number of returned visas resulting from the elimination of the diversity immigrant lottery, available in FY2014 and subsequent fiscal years to qualified immigrants who: (1) have a doctorate degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM degree) from a U.S. doctoral institution of higher education, or have completed a dental, medical, or veterinary residency program, have received a medical degree, a dentistry degree, a veterinary degree, or an osteopathic medicine/osteopathy degree; and (2) have taken all required courses, including courses taken by correspondence or by distance education, while physically present in the United States.  Makes unused EB-1 (priority worker) and EB-6 visas available to (EB-7 visa) aliens who: (1) hold a master's degree in a STEM field from a U.S. doctoral institution of higher education that was either part of a master's program that required at least two years of enrollment or part of a five-year combined baccalaureate-master's degree program in such field; (2) have taken all master's degree courses in a STEM field, including all courses taken by correspondence or by distance education, while physically present in the United States; and (3) hold a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field.  Prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) (Secretary) from approving an employer petition for an EB-6 or EB-7 alien unless the Secretary receives a Department of Labor determination that there are not sufficient American workers available for the job.

Grants such alien entrepreneur (and spouse and children) conditional permanent resident status. Requires termination of such status if the Secretary determines: (1) that the qualifying employment was intended as a means to evade U.S. immigration laws, or (2) other specified requirements were not met. Sets forth the conditions for an alien to petition for permanent resident status. Revises worldwide levels of employment- and family-based based immigrants.

Increases the number of alien physicians that a state may be allocated from 30 to 35 per fiscal year.

Excludes from numerical immigration limitations alien physicians who have completed national interest waiver requirements by working in a health care shortage area.  Increases the H-1B (specialty occupation) nonimmigrant visa limitation to 155,000 per fiscal year beginning in FY2014. Replaces the current higher education degree exemption from H-1B limitations with an exemption for up to 40,000 aliens with a STEM master's or doctorate degree (EB-6 and EB-7 aliens). Directs the Secretary to verify the authenticity of foreign educational degrees. Authorizes a related employer fee. Establishes in the Treasury the H-1B Educational Credential Verification Account.
