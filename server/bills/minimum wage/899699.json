The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat certain employers who make qualified wage subsidy payments to eligible Puerto Rico employees as having paid payroll taxes in an amount equal to the wage subsidy payment. An \u201celigible Puerto Rico employee\u201d is any individual who: (1) is a U.S. citizen, (2) has a Social Security number, and (3) certifies to the employer that he or she is a resident of Puerto Rico and intends to remain a resident for at least the next six months. A \u201cqualified wage subsidy payment\u201d is a payment equal to 50% of the excess (if any) of: (1) the median hourly wage for Puerto Rico ($10 for 2018 and 2019), over (2) the hourly wage paid to the eligible Puerto Rico employee. The bill sets forth reporting requirements for participating employers and requirements for determining the median hourly wage for Puerto Rico after 2019.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-05", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-05", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11910, "person_hash": "8u29wj1z", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Marco Rubio", "first_name": "Marco", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Rubio", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-FL", "ftm_eid": 12999040, "votesmart_id": 1601, "opensecrets_id": "N00030612", "knowwho_pid": 193597, "ballotpedia": "Marco_Rubio", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13489, "subject_name": "Caribbean area"}, {"subject_id": 13178, "subject_name": "Employment taxes"}, {"subject_id": 13234, "subject_name": "Labor standards"}, {"subject_id": 13263, "subject_name": "Puerto Rico"}, {"subject_id": 13319, "subject_name": "Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}, {"subject_id": 13491, "subject_name": "U.S. territories and protectorates"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13328, "subject_name": "Labor and employment"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1464240, "date": "2017-01-17", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB38/id/1464240", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s38/BILLS-115s38is.pdf", "text_size": 258695, "text_hash": "fb9e99da7d605418dfb13a543eaf524c"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
