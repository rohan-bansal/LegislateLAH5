Entitles individuals to a family and medical leave insurance (FMLI) benefit payment for each month they are engaged in qualified caregiving, not to exceed 60 qualified caregiving days per year. Qualified caregiving means an activity, except regular employment, for a reason an individual is entitled to leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Benefits would amount to 66 percent of an individual's monthly wages, based on highest annual earnings from the prior three years, up to a capped monthly amount, and would be indexed to the national average wage index. If a person takes the maximum number of days, the benefits would range from a minimum benefit of $580 to a maximum benefit of $4,000 per month in the program's first year. To be eligible for benefits, an individual is required to (i) be insured for disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act at the time his application is filed; (ii) have earned income from employment during the 12 months before filing the application; (iii) have filed an application for an FMLI benefit; and (iv) have been engaged in qualified caregiving, or anticipate being so engaged, during the 90-day period before the application is filed or within 30 days thereafter. The measure establishes the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Fund and requires FMLI benefit payments to be made only from this Fund. A tax of 0.2 percent is imposed on the wages received by every individual, and an excise tax of 0.2 percent of the wages paid in any calendar year by the employer with respect to their employment is imposed on employers. The measure has a delayed effective date of January 1, 2018.", "pending_committee_id": 148, "committee": {"committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-11", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2017-01-19", "committee_id": 3859, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Subcommittee #2"}, {"date": "2017-02-08", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-11", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/17 17102389D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-11", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-19", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Subcommittee #2", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-24", "action": "Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-02-08", "action": "Left in Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17732, "person_hash": "wvuqnac0", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Mark Levine", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "H.", "last_name": "Levine", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-045", "ftm_eid": 13981299, "votesmart_id": 152266, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 489443, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Levine_(Virginia)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 17727, "person_hash": "day26lea", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Jennifer Boysko", "first_name": "Jennifer", "middle_name": "Barton", "last_name": "Boysko", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-086", "ftm_eid": 6060458, "votesmart_id": 144515, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 456390, "ballotpedia": "Jennifer_Boysko", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 1472, "person_hash": "ki6i53nv", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Patrick Hope", "first_name": "Patrick", "middle_name": "A.", "last_name": "Hope", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-047", "ftm_eid": 6498271, "votesmart_id": 111176, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 282967, "ballotpedia": "Patrick_Hope", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 890, "person_hash": "dndz7r74", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Kaye Kory", "first_name": "L.
