Defines the term \"skills gap\" as the difference, or gap, between the current supply of labor and skills of the workforce and that which is desired by employers. Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to require the Secretary of Labor to award competitive grants to states to provide funds to local boards for provision of technical school training subsidies in local areas through one-stop delivery systems to pay tuition costs for the career and technical education of unemployed individuals enrolled or accepted at a technical school. Limits the aggregate amount of subsidies to an individual to $2,000.  Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a refundable tax credit for: (1) 60% of the excess of the aggregate wages paid to their employees in 2014 over the aggregate wages paid them in 2013, and (2) 40% of the excess of such wages paid during 2015 over the aggregate inflation-adjusted wages paid during 2014.
