Requires private employers with 50 or more employees to give to each full-time employee paid medical leave. Paid medical leave would accrue at a rate of no less than one hour for every 50 hours worked in 2019. In 2020 and subsequent years, paid medical leave would accrue at a rate of no less than one hour for every 30 hours worked. Paid medical leave accrues at different rates for an employer that commences its business operations after January 1, 2019. An employee would be entitled to use accrued medical leave beginning on the ninetieth calendar day of employment. The bill would require an employer to provide paid medical leave, upon the request of the employee, for diagnosis, care, or treatment of health conditions of the employee or the employee's family member. The bill would prohibit an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee who requests paid medical leave. The bill would require employers to satisfy specified posting and notice and recordkeeping requirements and would require the Commissioner of Labor and Industry (the Commissioner) to administer and enforce these requirements and to investigate alleged violations of these requirements. The bill would authorize the Commissioner to impose specified civil penalties for violations. The Commissioner would be authorized to bring an action to recover specified civil penalties against an offender. The Commissioner would also be able to recover attorney fees of one-third of the amount set forth in the final order or judgment. The measure would not apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provides for paid medical leave, nor would it lessen any other obligations of the employer to employees.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-09", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-09", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/10/18 18100961D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-09", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-01-22", "action": "Committee amendments", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-22", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (11-Y 4-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16176, "person_hash": "vzy4phmh", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jennifer Wexton", "first_name": "Jennifer", "middle_name": "T.", "last_name": "Wexton", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-033", "ftm_eid": 19907288, "votesmart_id": 147013, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 484877, "ballotpedia": "Jennifer_Wexton", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1678904, "date": "2018-01-09", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB421/id/1678904", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+SB421+hil", "text_size": 19519, "text_hash": "fb45d3d8890a4a4968a1f0783195692e"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 686721, "date": "2018-01-22", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (11-Y 4-N)", "yea": 11, "nay": 4, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB421/id/686721", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+S02V0025+SB0421"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-01-22", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}]}}
