The bill requires (1) the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to eligible entities to implement certain formal and informal engineering education programs in elementary and secondary schools, and (2) the use of certain career and technical education program funds for supporting a hands-on learning approach. The bill establishes in the Department of Labor an Office of Apprenticeship, including a National Advisory Committee on Apprenticeships, to promote apprenticeship programs. Labor and ED must establish a voluntary Registered Apprenticeship-College Collaborative consisting of the sponsors carrying out registered apprenticeship programs, two- or four-year post secondary educational institutions, and organizations that represent such programs or institutions. The bill requires states to provide a Labor-approved reemployment bonus program for individuals currently receiving unemployment benefits. It also allows states to use workforce development funds for a wage insurance program for individuals age 50 and over (age 45 and over for individuals in economically distressed communities) and establishes a training voucher program to assist workers in obtaining job skills training.", "pending_committee_id": 2367, "committee": {"committee_id": 2367, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114,
