H-1B employer application requirements are revised. The bill establishes an H-1B visa allocation system, with first priority reserved for aliens who have earned an advanced degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from a U.S. institution of higher education. The bill requires completion of a U.S. degree (or an equivalent foreign degree) as a qualification for \"specialty occupation\" eligibility, eliminating experience in a specialty as an equivalent to the completion of such a degree. The bill prescribes an H-1B labor condition application fee. The Department of Labor may issue subpoenas and seek appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations to ensure H-1B employer compliance. The period of authorized admission for an H-1B nonimmigrant is reduced from six to three years, with a three-year extension available for aliens with extraordinary ability or with advanced degrees, or professors. The bill denies an H-1B visa to any alien normally classifiable as an H-1 nonimmigrant who seeks U.S. admission to provide services in a specialty occupation. Labor may investigate applications for fraud and conduct H-1B compliance audits. Labor shall conduct annual audits of companies with more than 100 employees who work in the United States if more than 15% of those employees are H-1B nonimmigrants. The bill increases certain employer penalties, including the penalty for displacing a U.S. worker. An employer that violates any H-1B requirement shall be liable to the harmed employee for lost wages and benefits. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall give Labor any information in materials submitted by H-1B employers as part of the petition adjudication process that indicates employer noncompliance with H-1B visa program requirements. Labor may hire 200 additional employees to administer H-1B programs. The bill prohibits an employer, unless it receives a waiver from Labor, from hiring an L-1 nonimmigrant for more than one year who will: (1) serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge, and (2) be stationed primarily at the worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer. No employer may replace a U.S. worker with an L-1 worker. The bill prescribes L-1 requirements regarding: (1) employer petitions for employment at a new office, (2) wage rates and working conditions, and (3) employer penalties. Labor may initiate an L-1 employer investigation. Authority to administer L-1 visa blanket petitions is transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security.", "pending_committee_id": 2850, "committee": {"committee_id": 2850, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Immigration And Border Security"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2016-07-07", "committee_id": 2309, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Judiciary"}, {"date": "2016-08-11", "committee_id": 2850, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Immigration And Border Security"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-07-07", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-07-07", "action": "Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-07-07", "action": "Referred to House Judiciary", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-07-07", "action": "Referred to House Education and the Workforce", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-08-11", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 8987, "person_hash": "1narqjxv", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Bill Pascrell", "first_name": "Bill", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Pascrell", "suffix": "Jr.", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-NJ-9", "ftm_eid": 16580040, "votesmart_id": 478, "opensecrets_id": "N00000751", "knowwho_pid": 158959, "ballotpedia": "Bill_Pascrell", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9343, "person_hash": "fzx7t6ki", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Dana Rohrabacher", "first_name": "Dana", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Rohrabacher", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-CA-48", "ftm_eid": 9685202, "votesmart_id": 26763, "opensecrets_id": "N00007151", "knowwho_pid": 158762, "ballotpedia": "Dana_Rohrabacher", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13160, "subject_name": "Department of Labor"}, {"subject_id": 13191, "subject_name": "Foreign labor"}, {"subject_id": 13198, "subject_name": "Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13403, "subject_name": "Immigration status and procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13655, "subject_name": "Science and engineering education"}, {"subject_id": 13648, "subject_name": "User charges and fees"}, {"subject_id": 13527, "subject_name": "Visas and passports"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13346, "subject_name": "Immigration"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1423948, "date": "2016-07-27", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB5657/id/1423948", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr5657/BILLS-114hr5657ih.pdf", "text_size": 331332, "text_hash": "21da755d81bfc734f82150c5ac8d6522"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
