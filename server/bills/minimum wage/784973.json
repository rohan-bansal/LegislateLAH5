Amends FSEUCA of 1970 to postpone similarly from December 31, 2013, to December 31, 2015, termination of the period during which a state may determine its \"on\" and \"off\" indicators according to specified temporary substitutions in its formula.

Subjects activities funded under this Act to federal labor standards and nondiscrimination protections. Subtitle D--Prohibition of Discrimination in Employment on the Basis of an Individual's Status as Unemployed Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2015 Makes it an unlawful practice for certain employers to: publish a job advertisement or announcement that includes provisions indicating that an individual's status as unemployed disqualifies the individual for employment or that the employer will not consider or hire an individual for employment based on such status, fail or refuse to consider or hire an individual because of such status, or direct or request that an employment agency take an individual's status into account to disqualify an applicant for consideration for employment or when screening or referring employees.
