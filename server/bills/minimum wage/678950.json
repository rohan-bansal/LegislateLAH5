Requires private employers to give to each full-time employee paid sick days, to be accrued at a rate of no less than one hour for every 30 hours worked. An employee would be entitled to use accrued sick days beginning on the ninetieth calendar day of employment. An employer may limit an employee's use of paid sick days to 24 hours or three days in each calendar year. The bill would require an employer to provide paid sick days, upon the request of the employee, for diagnosis, care, or treatment of health conditions of the employee or the employee's family member. The bill would prohibit an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee who requests paid sick days. The bill would require employers to satisfy specified posting and notice and recordkeeping requirements and would require the Commissioner of Labor and Industry (the Commissioner) to administer and enforce these requirements and to investigate alleged violations of these requirements. The bill would authorize the Commissioner to impose specified civil penalties for violations. The Commissioner or Attorney General would be authorized to bring an action to recover specified civil penalties against an offender, as well as attorney fees and costs. The measure would not apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provides for paid sick days, nor would it lessen any other obligations of the employer to employees.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2015-01-14", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-01-14", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/14/15 15102985D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2015-01-14", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2015-01-27", "action": "Tabled in Commerce and Labor by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 890, "person_hash": "dndz7r74", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Kaye Kory", "first_name": "L.
