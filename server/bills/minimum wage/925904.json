H-1B employer application requirements are revised. The bill establishes an H-1B visa allocation system, with first priority reserved for aliens who have earned an advanced degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from a U.S. institution of higher education. The bill requires completion of a U.S. degree (or an equivalent foreign degree) as a qualification for \"specialty occupation\" eligibility, eliminating experience in a specialty as an equivalent to the completion of such a degree. The bill prescribes an H-1B labor condition application fee. The Department of Labor may issue subpoenas and seek appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations to ensure H-1B employer compliance. The period of authorized admission for an H-1B nonimmigrant is reduced from six to three years, with a three-year extension available for aliens with extraordinary ability or with advanced degrees or professors. The bill denies an H-1B visa to any alien normally classifiable as an H-1 nonimmigrant who seeks U.S. admission to provide services in a specialty occupation. Labor may investigate applications for fraud and conduct H-1B compliance audits. Labor shall conduct annual audits of companies with more than 100 employees who work in the United States if more than 15% of those employees are H-1B nonimmigrants. The bill increases certain employer penalties, including the penalty for displacing a U.S. worker. An employer that violates any H-1B requirement shall be liable to the harmed employee for lost wages and benefits. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall give Labor any information in materials submitted by H-1B employers as part of the petition adjudication process that indicates employer noncompliance with H-1B visa program requirements. Labor may hire 200 additional employees to administer H-1B programs. The bill prohibits an employer, unless it receives a waiver from Labor, from hiring for more than one year an L-1 nonimmigrant who will: (1) serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge, and (2) be stationed primarily at the worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer. No employer may replace a U.S. worker with an L-1 worker. The bill prescribes L-1 requirements regarding: (1) employer petitions for employment at a new office, (2) wage rates and working conditions, and (3) employer penalties. Labor may initiate an L-1 employer investigation. Authority to administer L-1 visa blanket petitions is transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security.", "pending_committee_id": 2330, "committee": {"committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-20", "committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-20", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9484, "person_hash": "1zy2f3m5", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Chuck Grassley", "first_name": "Chuck", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Grassley", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-IA", "ftm_eid": 6338995, "votesmart_id": 53293, "opensecrets_id": "N00001758", "knowwho_pid": 165215, "ballotpedia": "Chuck_Grassley", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9405, "person_hash": "i4x14koe", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Richard Durbin", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Durbin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-IL", "ftm_eid": 3414130, "votesmart_id": 26847, "opensecrets_id": "N00004981", "knowwho_pid": 165219, "ballotpedia": "Dick_Durbin", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9402, "person_hash": "bsdo1kgr", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Sherrod Brown", "first_name": "Sherrod", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Brown", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OH", "ftm_eid": 3439679, "votesmart_id": 27018, "opensecrets_id": "N00003535", "knowwho_pid": 159013, "ballotpedia": "Sherrod_Brown", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 11199, "person_hash": "crmbr7rg", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Richard Blumenthal", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Blumenthal", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CT", "ftm_eid": 6378136, "votesmart_id": 1568, "opensecrets_id": "N00031685", "knowwho_pid": 218586, "ballotpedia": "Richard_Blumenthal", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9434, "person_hash": "tz8vuv7x", "party_id": "3", "state_id": 52, "party": "I", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Bernard Sanders", "first_name": "Bernard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Sanders", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-VT", "ftm_eid": 9960190, "votesmart_id": 27110, "opensecrets_id": "N00000528", "knowwho_pid": 159116, "ballotpedia": "Bernie_Sanders", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 5, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "HB1303", "sast_bill_id": 982122}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13160, "subject_name": "Department of Labor"}, {"subject_id": 13191, "subject_name": "Foreign labor"}, {"subject_id": 13198, "subject_name": "Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13403, "subject_name": "Immigration status and procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13655, "subject_name": "Science and engineering education"}, {"subject_id": 13648, "subject_name": "User charges and fees"}, {"subject_id": 13527, "subject_name": "Visas and passports"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13346, "subject_name": "Immigration"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1491948, "date": "2017-02-01", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB180/id/1491948", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s180/BILLS-115s180is.pdf", "text_size": 329291, "text_hash": "b1542f52341f6463966029867ee6157a"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
