The bill calculates taxable income for individual taxpayers by subtracting a basic standard deduction and an additional standard deduction for each dependent from the total of wages, retirement distributions, and unemployment compensation. \"Business taxable income\" is gross active income reduced by certain deductions for the cost of business inputs, wages, and retirement contributions. The bill imposes an employer tax on the value of excludable compensation provided to employees not engaged in business activity of 19% for the first two years after an election is made under this bill and 17% thereafter. The bill also repeals the estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer taxes.
