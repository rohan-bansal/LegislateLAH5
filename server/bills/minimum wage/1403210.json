Prohibits Virginia Equal Pay Act; civil penalties. Prohibits public and private employers from discriminating between employees on the basis of membership in a protected class in the payment of wages or other compensation, including benefits, by paying wages or other compensation to employees who are members of a protected class at a rate less than the rate at which it pays wages or other compensation to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work. The measure also prohibits an employer from discriminating between employees by providing less favorable employment opportunities on the basis of membership in a protected class, limiting an employee's right to discuss wages, relying on the wage history of a prospective employee in considering the prospective employee for employment or determining the wages that the prospective employee is to be paid by the employer upon hire, or taking certain retaliatory actions against an employee. The measure also establishes criteria for when wage differentials between employees are permitted, but requires an employer to (i) provide a prospective employee with the wage range for the position for which the prospective employee is applying upon request or prior to inquiring about the prospective employee's wage expectations or providing an offer of compensation and (ii) maintain records of the wages and wage rates, job classifications, and other terms and conditions of employment for a period of three years. The measure gives an employee who is the subject of a violation a right of action to recover, for certain violations, the greater of compensatory damages or $10,000, liquidated damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. Violations are also subject to civil penalties.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2021-01-11", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-01-11", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/21 21100227D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-11", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-01-18", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17727, "person_hash": "day26lea", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jennifer Boysko", "first_name": "Jennifer", "middle_name": "Barton", "last_name": "Boysko", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-033", "ftm_eid": 6060458, "votesmart_id": 144515, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 456390, "ballotpedia": "Jennifer_Boysko", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 21451, "person_hash": "9hryy1b3", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Ghazala Hashmi", "first_name": "Ghazala", "middle_name": "F.", "last_name": "Hashmi", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-010", "ftm_eid": 47299328, "votesmart_id": 186377, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 702466, "ballotpedia": "Ghazala_Hashmi", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 772, "person_hash": "5ifqmtff", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mamie Locke", "first_name": "Mamie", "middle_name": "E.", "last_name": "Locke", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-002", "ftm_eid": 6410995, "votesmart_id": 50935, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 219691, "ballotpedia": "Mamie_Locke", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 718, "person_hash": "wpb2qlsc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jennifer McClellan", "first_name": "Jennifer", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "McClellan", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-009", "ftm_eid": 5703418, "votesmart_id": 58655, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 241253, "ballotpedia": "Jenn_McClellan", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2237783, "date": "2021-01-11", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1228/id/2237783", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+ful+SB1228+hil", "text_size": 15935, "text_hash": "2469c721ace130ede9f6ee2869322891"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 988309, "date": "2021-01-18", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB1228/id/988309", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+vot+S02V0022+SB1228"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2021-01-18", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}]}}
