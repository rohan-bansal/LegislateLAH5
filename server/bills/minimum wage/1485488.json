Additionally, DOT must prioritize projects that (1) serve a frontline, vulnerable, or disadvantaged community; (2) are located in an area that has experienced high adverse health and environmental impacts on minority and low-income populations; (3) require federal funds in order to complete an overall financing package; or (4) add a new green space or new state or local park units and outdoor recreational areas. Grants issued under the program may not be less than $2 million, with the exception of grants for project planning, preparation, or design, which are not subject to a minimum amount.
