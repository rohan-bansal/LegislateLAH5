This bill amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act with respect to determining entitlement to and the amount of any monthly benefit, including any lump-sum death payment, payable under OASDI on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of any individual. Such an individual shall be deemed to have been paid a wage (according to a specified formula) during each month during which the individual was engaged for at least 80 hours in providing care to a dependent relative without monetary compensation for up to five years of such service. This bill shall not apply in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment if a larger benefit or payment would be payable without its application.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2016-03-17", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-03-17", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 8986, "person_hash": "m2pvngcc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Christopher Murphy", "first_name": "Christopher", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Murphy", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-CT-5", "ftm_eid": 6384200, "votesmart_id": 17189, "opensecrets_id": "N00027566", "knowwho_pid": 193324, "ballotpedia": "Chris_Murphy_(Connecticut)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9434, "person_hash": "tz8vuv7x", "party_id": "3", "state_id": 52, "party": "I", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Bernard Sanders", "first_name": "Bernard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Sanders", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-VT", "ftm_eid": 9960190, "votesmart_id": 27110, "opensecrets_id": "N00000528", "knowwho_pid": 159116, "ballotpedia": "Bernie_Sanders", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB3377", "sast_bill_id": 788368}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13383, "subject_name": "Social welfare"}, {"subject_id": 13874, "subject_name": "Adult day care"}, {"subject_id": 13128, "subject_name": "Aging"}, {"subject_id": 13668, "subject_name": "Child care and development"}, {"subject_id": 13166, "subject_name": "Disability and paralysis"}, {"subject_id": 13470, "subject_name": "Family relationships"}, {"subject_id": 13279, "subject_name": "Social security and elderly assistance"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1374559, "date": "2016-03-22", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB2721/id/1374559", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s2721/BILLS-114s2721is.pdf", "text_size": 255796, "text_hash": "db0084c37925d11bf1c16c2883fabef0"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
