The measure limits the Act's exemption for babysitters to those not employed more than 10 hours per week. The measure eliminates the Act's exemption for persons employed by an employer that does not have four or more employees. The measure requires a court to award attorney fees incurred by an employee who is awarded judgment in an action for a violation of the Act; currently, awarding such fees is permitted but not required. The measure expands the information an employer is required to provide to its employees when wages are paid.
