Requires current participants in the General Assembly Retirement System to make a one-time, irrevocable election of one of the following: (i) the traditional benefit package, (ii) the benefit package made available under P.A. 96-889, or (iii) a self-managed plan. Authorizes persons who first became (or become) participants on or after January 1, 2011 to irrevocably elect either: (i) the benefit package made available under P.A. 96-889 or (ii) the self-managed plan. Sets forth the requirements for the self-managed plan and provides that it is the default plan if a participant fails to make an election. Provides that, beginning in fiscal year 2013, the State's required contribution is the greater of 6% of the applicable payroll or one-half of the actuarially-determined normal cost of the benefit package for new hires and that the required employee contribution will be based on the benefit package elected by the participant. Amends the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act to provide that the changes to the Code made by the amendatory Act control when there is a conflict with the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act.
