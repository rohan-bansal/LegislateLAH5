Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Secretary of the Treasury to jointly establish a loan program for small business concerns (i.e., businesses with fewer than 25 employees).

Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to obligate to be expended by September 30, 2010, certain funds for research and development by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase the maximum loan amounts available to small businesses for plant acquisition, construction, conversion, and expansion.
