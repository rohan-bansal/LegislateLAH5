The bill also phases in over three years an increase of the minimum wage for new employees less than 20 years old from $4.25 to $6 per hour, and increases the length of time an employee may be paid this lower minimum wage. Both minimum wages shall be adjusted for inflation every two years.

The bill increases civil penalties for various violations related to hiring, recruiting, and referring ineligible employees.
