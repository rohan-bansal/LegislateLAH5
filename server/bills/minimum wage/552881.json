This Act creates a nine member, politically-balanced Committee with financial, accounting, or banking experience to select the sites and licensees. This Act also increases the number of required racing days to reflect the current amount of racing, and prevents the addition of video lottery agents from triggering a reduction in the minimum number of days that existing harness tracks must offer harness racing. Finally, this Act also expresses the intent of the General Assembly that the new video lottery casinos will be subject to a one-time license fee and ongoing license fees, as well as such fees as are necessary to create a level playing field for competition with video lottery agents who operate horse racing or harness racing, and directs the Department of Finance to prepare legislation implementing that intent.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2013-05-09", "committee_id": 1653, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Gaming & Parimutuels"}], "history": [{"date": "2013-05-09", "action": "Assigned to Gaming & Parimutuels Committee in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2013-05-09", "action": "Introduced in House and assigned to Gaming & Parimutuels Committee", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 4424, "person_hash": "ce2kfhwy", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 8, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "D.E.
