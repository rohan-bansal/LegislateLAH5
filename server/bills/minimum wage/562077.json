Requires support recipients to be full-time or half-time students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants. Sets the student support level for unpaid internships at: (1) the higher of the federal or state minimum wage for each hour of the internship, if the internship occurs while the student is enrolled in classes; and (2) the student's reasonable cost of living expenses, if the internship occurs while the student is not enrolled in classes. Sets the support level for paid internships by reducing the amount the student would receive for an unpaid internship by the amount the paid internship provides to the student. Caps the total support a student may receive for full-time and part-time internships. Makes that support nontaxable and excludes it from the calculation of a student's need or eligibility for financial assistance under title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.", "pending_committee_id": 2547, "committee": {"committee_id": 2547, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2013-07-11", "committee_id": 2301, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education And The Workforce"}, {"date": "2013-07-23", "committee_id": 2628, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Human Resources"}, {"date": "2013-09-13", "committee_id": 2547, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training"}], "history": [{"date": "2013-07-11", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2013-07-11", "action": "Referred to House Education and the Workforce", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2013-07-11", "action": "Referred to House Ways and Means", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2013-07-23", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Human Resources.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2013-09-13", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 13869, "person_hash": "zwfqam9j", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Suzanne Bonamici", "first_name": "Suzanne", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Bonamici", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-OR-1", "ftm_eid": 339835, "votesmart_id": 59641, "opensecrets_id": "N00033474", "knowwho_pid": 249764, "ballotpedia": "Suzanne_Bonamici", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13171, "subject_name": "Education programs funding"}, {"subject_id": 13176, "subject_name": "Employment and training programs"}, {"subject_id": 13215, "subject_name": "Higher education"}, {"subject_id": 13226, "subject_name": "Income tax exclusion"}, {"subject_id": 13286, "subject_name": "Student aid and college costs"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}, {"subject_id": 13329, "subject_name": "Education"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 872710, "date": "2013-07-12", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB2659/id/872710", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/hr2659/BILLS-113hr2659ih.pdf", "text_size": 269607, "text_hash": "c70e3c52e1d5a2dac5e3c2cb20d848d3"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
