Provides that an employee who is required to travel in connection with his or her employment and who suffers an injury while in travel status shall be eligible for benefits only if the injury arises out of and in the course of employment while he or she is actively engaged in the duties of employment. Defines \"accident\" and \"injury\". Provides that \"injury\" includes the aggravation of a pre-existing condition by an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, but only for so long as the aggravation of the pre-existing condition continues to be the major contributing cause of the disability. Provides that an injury resulting directly or indirectly from idiopathic causes is not compensable. Further provides that, with respect to the computation of compensation to be paid to an employee who had previously sustained an injury resulting in payment of compensation for partial disability for injuries not involving serious and permanent disfigurement and injuries for which the Act provides a schedule of benefits, the amount of the prior award for the partial disability with respect to the same portion of the body shall be deducted. Limits cumulative awards for partial disability to 500 weeks, which shall constitute a complete loss of use of the body as a whole. Provides that no employer shall be required to pay temporary partial disability benefits to an employee who has been discharged for cause. Provides that injuries to the shoulder are deemed to be injuries to the arm and injuries to the hip are deemed to be injuries to the leg. Provides for the computation of compensation when there are multiple employers and when there is less than full-time work.
