Provides that an injury by accident is compensable only if the accident was the primary factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Provides that certain conditions and impairments of health suffered by firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians shall be rebuttably presumed not to arise out of employment unless the accident is the primary factor in causing the resulting medical condition. Abolishes certain notice and election provisions in connection with preferred providers. Specifies that fees for certain prescriptions shall be limited to the manufacturer's Average Wholesale Price (rather than the Average Wholesale Price).
