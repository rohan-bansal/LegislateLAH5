Eligible employees must be (1) U.S. citizens, (2) have Social Security numbers, and (3) certify their residency in Puerto Rico and intent to remain residents for at least the next six months. Employers who opt in must pay their eligible employees a minimum wage of $5. The Department of the Treasury then subsidizes those wages in an amount equal to 50% of the difference between $10 and the hourly wages the employees receive from their employers. For example, if a participating employer pays their eligible employees $5 hourly, the subsidy would equal $2.50 for an effective hourly wage of $7.50. Participating employers may elect advance payment of the aggregate subsidy amounts that exceed the employer's aggregate payroll taxes for the applicable period based on estimates the employer provides to Treasury. The bill treats employers who make such wage subsidy payments to eligible Puerto Rico employees as having paid payroll taxes in an amount equal to such payments.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-03-18", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-03-18", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11910, "person_hash": "8u29wj1z", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Marco Rubio", "first_name": "Marco", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Rubio", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-FL", "ftm_eid": 12999040, "votesmart_id": 1601, "opensecrets_id": "N00030612", "knowwho_pid": 193597, "ballotpedia": "Marco_Rubio", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13328, "subject_name": "Labor and employment"}, {"subject_id": 13489, "subject_name": "Caribbean area"}, {"subject_id": 13178, "subject_name": "Employment taxes"}, {"subject_id": 13234, "subject_name": "Labor standards"}, {"subject_id": 13263, "subject_name": "Puerto Rico"}, {"subject_id": 13319, "subject_name": "Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}, {"subject_id": 13491, "subject_name": "U.S. territories and protectorates"}, {"subject_id": 13297, "subject_name": "Wages and earnings"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2372309, "date": "2021-04-15", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB841/id/2372309", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/s841/BILLS-117s841is.pdf", "text_size": 268887, "text_hash": "4537c914d93ff5f4e605775c00f48095"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
