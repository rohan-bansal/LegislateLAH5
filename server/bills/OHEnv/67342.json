Specifies that if the certificate is rejected through the referendum, then the certificate shall be one of the following (Sec. 1): Invalid, if it is located in the unincorporated area of a single township; or Modified, if it is located in more than one township, to exclude the areas of each township whose electors rejected the certificate, but if all townships with electors voting on the referendum reject the certificate, then it is invalid. Defines a “clean air resource” as an electric generating facility fueled by nuclear power meeting certain criteria or an electric generating facility that uses or will use solar energy as the primary energy source that satisfies certain criteria and has obtained a certificate from the power siting board prior to June 1st, 2019 (Sec. 1). Establishes the Ohio Clean Air program, which terminates on December 31st, 2026 (Sec. 1) Authorizes any person owning or controlling a clean air resource to submit a written application with the Ohio air quality development authority for certification as a clean air resource to be eligible to participate in the Ohio clean air program (Sec. 1). Requires a clean air resource to remain certified as a clean air resource as long as the resource continues to meet the definition of a clean air resource (Sec. 1). Establishes the Ohio clean air program fund, in the custody of the state treasurer but not part of the state treasury (Sec. 1). Specifies that beginning January 1st, 2020 and ending December 31st, 2026, each retail electric customer shall pay a per-account monthly charge for deposit into the Ohio clean air program fund, the charges being as followed (Sec. 1): For residential customers, $0.50 cents a month during 2020, but from 2021 to 2026, $1 dollar a month; For commercial customers, a charge designed and structured by the public utilities commission so that the average charge will be, for the year 2020, $10 dollars a month, and from 2021 to 2026, $15 dollars a month; For industrial customers a charge designed and structured by the public utilities commission so that the average charge will be $250 dollars; and For commercial or industrial customers exceeding 45 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a single location in the preceding year, a charge of $2,500 dollars a month. Requires an independent third party to conduct an annual audit of the Ohio clean air program annually from 2021 to 2027 (Sec. 1). Defines a “clean air credit” as a credit that represents the clean air attributes of one megawatt hour of electric energy produced from a certified clean air resource (Sec. 1). Requires a certified air resource to earn a clean air credit for each megawatt hour of electricity it produces (Sec. 1). Establishes the price for each credit to be $9 dollars (Sec. 1). Requires the Ohio air quality development authority to direct the treasurer of state to send money from the Ohio clean air program fund to each owner of a certified clean air resource in the amount equal to the amount of credits earned by the resource during the previous month multiplied by the credit price, each month (Sec. 1). Requires an electric distribution utility to submit an application to the Ohio air quality development authority for reimbursement from the clean air fund if certain conditions are met, in which the authority must direct the treasurer of state to send money to them within 90 days (Sec. 1). Authorizes certified clean air resources fueled by nuclear power seeking a reduction in the taxable value of their property to file a petition for reassessment as long as it is not below the taxable values for the property when the amendments were added to the bill (Sec. 1). Defines “credit price adjustment” as a reduction to the price for each clean air credit equal to the market price index minus the strike price (Sec. 1). Defines “strike price” as $46 dollars per megawatt hour (Sec. 1). Defines “market price index” as the sum expressed in dollars per megawatt hour of both (Sec. 1): The projected energy prices, determined using “futures contracts for the PJM AEP-Dayton hub;” and The projected capacity prices, determined using “PJM’s rest-of-RTO market clearing price.” Requires the clean air authority to apply a credit price adjustment for the upcoming program year if the market price index exceeds the strike price on the first day of April, only applying to clean air resources fueled by nuclear power (Sec. 1)."}
