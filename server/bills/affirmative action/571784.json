Defines \"misappropriate\" as the acquisition or disclosure of a trade secret under specified circumstances through improper means, including theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, and espionage through electronic means. Excludes reverse engineering or independent derivation from the categories of improper means when such activity alone is the only alleged conduct.  Permits an action to arise from conduct outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States if the conduct, either by itself or in combination with conduct within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, causes or is reasonably anticipated to cause an injury: (1) within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or (2) to a U.S. person.  Provides for an affirmative defense to such an action if each alleged trade secret in dispute was readily ascertainable through proper means by other persons who did not already know the trade secret at the time of the alleged conduct. Authorizes a court, upon an ex parte application, to order the seizure of any property used to commit or facilitate specified conduct alleged in the civil action.", "pending_committee_id": 2330, "committee": {"committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2013-11-21", "committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2013-11-21", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9357, "person_hash": "hdd6cpj4", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jeff Flake", "first_name": "Jeff", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Flake", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-AZ", "ftm_eid": 8753041, "votesmart_id": 28128, "opensecrets_id": "N00009573", "knowwho_pid": 205546, "ballotpedia": "Jeff_Flake", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9469, "person_hash": "58q1t500", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jeff Merkley", "first_name": "Jeff", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Merkley", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OR", "ftm_eid": 13005237, "votesmart_id": 23644, "opensecrets_id": "N00029303", "knowwho_pid": 198129, "ballotpedia": "Jeff_Merkley", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13414, "subject_name": "Crimes against property"}, {"subject_id": 13445, "subject_name": "Jurisdiction and venue"}, {"subject_id": 13864, "subject_name": "Legal fees and court costs"}, {"subject_id": 13807, "subject_name": "Trade secrets and economic espionage"}, {"subject_id": 13637, "subject_name": "Commerce"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 899804, "date": "2013-12-02", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1770/id/899804", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/s1770/BILLS-113s1770is.pdf", "text_size": 265736, "text_hash": "4a5be20c23ae5ad9c3ac00407ada595f"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
