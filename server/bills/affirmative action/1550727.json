Prohibits a party to a user action from tracking another user whenever the party receives a do-not-track signal indicating a user preference not to be tracked, with some exceptions. Provides that data that has been sufficiently de-identified such that it is rendered anonymous data may be processed for any purpose. Provides that a party may disregard a user's do-not-track signal when the user has given express affirmative consent to track. Provides that an organization may process data for specified uses if the organization: (i) limits the amount of identifiable data collected; (ii) limits the retention of identifiable data to no longer than what is reasonably needed for the permitted uses; (iii) uses anonymous data; (iv) processes the data separately from systems that are used for purposes other than the permitted uses; and (v) does not process the data beyond the permitted uses. Requires an organization that engages in tracking to describe, in understandable language and syntax such that an ordinary user can comprehend, its practices with respect to do-not-track signals in its privacy statement or similar notice, available through a clear and prominent link on the home page of its website. Prohibits a party from blocking a user's do-not-track signal. Provides that the Attorney General shall enforce the Act. Permits a user whose identifiable information has been processed in violation of the Act to bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Preempts home rule powers.
