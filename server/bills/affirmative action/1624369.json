This Act allows tenants to bring an action of rent escrow to pay rent into the court because of asserted defects or conditions. Alternatively, the tenant may refuse to pay rent and raise the existence of the asserted defects or conditions as an affirmative defense to an action for summary possession or an action for nonpayment of rent. This Act requires the tenant to give proper notice and allow the landlord the opportunity to effect repairs. This Act requires the court to make appropriate findings of fact and to make any order that justice of the case may require, which may include termination of the lease and return of the leased premises to the landlord, order that the action for rent escrow be dismissed, order that the amount of rent be reduced in amount determined by the court to be fair and equitable, or order the landlord to make the repairs or correct the conditions complained of by the tenant.", "pending_committee_id": 1646, "committee": {"committee_id": 1646, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Appropriations"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2022-06-10", "committee_id": 1657, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Housing & Community Affairs"}, {"date": "2022-06-28", "committee_id": 1646, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Appropriations"}], "history": [{"date": "2022-06-10", "action": "Introduced and Assigned to Housing & Community Affairs Committee in House", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2022-06-22", "action": "Reported Out of Committee (Housing & Community Affairs) in House with 3 Favorable, 4 On Its Merits", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2022-06-24", "action": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 477 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2022-06-28", "action": "Assigned to Appropriations Committee in House", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 19895, "person_hash": "gnx3igcd", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 8, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Sherry Dorsey Walker", "first_name": "Sherry", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Dorsey Walker", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-003", "ftm_eid": 25085221, "votesmart_id": 184862, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 495101, "ballotpedia": "Sherry_Dorsey_Walker", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 19921, "person_hash": "ny0zei3m", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 8, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Darius Brown", "first_name": "Darius", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Brown", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-002", "ftm_eid": 39595778, "votesmart_id": 143827, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 256797, "ballotpedia": "Darius_Brown", "sponsor_type_id": 3, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 21729, "person_hash": "xj0kncya", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 8, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Larry Lambert", "first_name": "Larry", "middle_name": "D.", "last_name": "Lambert", "suffix": "Jr.", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-007", "ftm_eid": 45401496, "votesmart_id": 184869, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 669773, "ballotpedia": "Larry_Lambert", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 4417, "person_hash": "wgq814xo", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 8, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Valerie Longhurst", "first_name": "Valerie", "middle_name": "J.", "last_name": "Longhurst", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-015", "ftm_eid": 6415714, "votesmart_id": 30666, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 227085, "ballotpedia": "Valerie_Longhurst", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2595115, "date": "0000-00-00", "type": "Draft", "type_id": 9, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/text/HB477/id/2595115", "state_link": "https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=129684&legislationTypeId=1&docTypeId=2&legislationName=HB477", "text_size": 25900, "text_hash": "b587653bf9860dbbfab30ca8fc5d33fd"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2022-06-22", "time": "17:00", "location": "House Majority Hearing Room (H217)", "description": "Housing & Community Affairs"}]}}
