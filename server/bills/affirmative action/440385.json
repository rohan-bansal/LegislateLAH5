Requires employers to maintain and preserve records regarding the rate of pay, hours worked, earnings due, wages paid, and related matters for each employee. The measure provides a standard for how an employee, in an action to collect unpaid wages, may meet his burden of establishing that he is entitled to the wages. The measure also amends an employee's existing private right of action for unpaid wages by requiring the court to award attorney fees and other costs to a prevailing employee. In such a proceeding, unless the employer shows good faith, the court shall award to the employee three times the amount of unpaid wages. An action for unpaid wages shall be commenced within two years after the action accrued, or within three years if the violation is willful. The measure will not become effective if a general fund appropriation restores funding for six wage investigator positions at the Department of Labor and Industry.", "pending_committee_id": 0,
