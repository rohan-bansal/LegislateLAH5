Prohibits an employer from (i) permitting an employee to be subjected to an abusive work environment, (ii) subjecting an employee to an abusive work environment, or (iii) retaliating against an employee because the employee brings or participates in an action, investigation, or proceeding related to the abusive work environment. The measure also prohibits the employer's agent or a coworker from subjecting an employee to an abusive work environment. The bill defines \"abusive work environment\" as a workplace in which an employee is subjected to abusive conduct severe enough to cause physical or psychological harm. The bill provides that an aggrieved employee may bring a private cause of action. In such a proceeding, the court may order injunctive relief; reinstatement; removal of any offending party from the employee's work environment; compensation for lost wages, benefits, and other remuneration; compensation for medical costs and emotional duress; punitive damages; and reasonable costs and attorney fees. Punitive damages are not allowed if the violation does not include an adverse employment action against the employee or result in lost work time, earnings, or other benefits.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-11", "committee_id": 148, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}, {"date": "2017-01-19", "committee_id": 3859, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Commerce and Labor: Subcommittee #2"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-11", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/17 17102769D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-11", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-19", "action": "Assigned C & L sub: Subcommittee #2", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-24", "action": "Subcommittee recommends striking from docket by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-26", "action": "Stricken from docket by Commerce and Labor by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 892, "person_hash": "bwbhvzfn", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Luke Torian", "first_name": "Luke", "middle_name": "E.", "last_name": "Torian", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-052", "ftm_eid": 13007353, "votesmart_id": 111179, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 282969, "ballotpedia": "Luke_Torian", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 243, "subject_name": "Labor and Employment"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1452791, "date": "2017-01-11", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2202/id/1452791", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+HB2202+hil", "text_size": 7678, "text_hash": "7c70780caa9bbc478aef304980e6cea1"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-24", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Room D- GAB", "description": "House Commerce and Labor - Subcommittee #2 Committee Hearing"}]}}
