Renames the Transportation Public-Private Partnership Advisory Committee the Transportation Public-Private Partnership Steering Committee (the Steering Committee) and provides that the Deputy Secretary of Transportation shall serve as the chairman of the Steering Committee. The bill provides that, under the Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995, a responsible public entity may grant approval for the development and/or operation of a transportation facility by a private entity if that private entity can develop and/or operate the transportation facility for less cost than the Department of Transportation (VDOT) or the Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT). The bill requires the chief executive officer of the responsible public entity to certify in writing to the Governor and the General Assembly that there has been no material change to the finding that a public-private partnership is in the best interest of the public since the finding was issued and that the public contribution requested by the private entity does not exceed the maximum public contribution. The bill clarifies that the finding of public interest by the Steering Committee shall be made after receipt of responses to the request for qualifications and prior to the issuance of the first draft request for proposals. The bill requires the responsible public entity, when such entity is VDOT or DRPT, to ensure competition through the procurement process and develop a public sector analysis of the cost for the responsible entity to develop and/or operate the transportation facility. The bill requires VDOT or DRPT and the Steering Committee to review the public sector analysis prior to the initiation of any procurement. The bill adds to the information required to be included in the finding of public interest a description of the benefits expected to be realized by the responsible public entity and a public sector analysis demonstrating that the private sector can deliver the project for less cost than the responsible public entity.
