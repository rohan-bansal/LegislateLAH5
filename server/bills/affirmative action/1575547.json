Provides that it is an affirmative defense to an eviction action if the court finds that the demand for possession is based upon a demand for possession relating to the entry of a barred individual onto any portion of the premises where the tenant, lessee, or household member who was the victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, stalking, or dating violence did not knowingly consent to the barred person entering the premises or a valid court order permitted the barred person's entry onto the premises. Provides that nothing in a provision regarding an affirmative defense for violence precludes a landlord from exercising any rights the landlord may have under existing local, State, federal, or common law to bar an individual who is not a tenant or lessee or member of the tenant's or lessee's household. Removes provisions providing that: a landlord shall have the power to bar the presence of a person from the premises owned by the landlord who is not a tenant or lessee or who is not a member of the tenant's or lessee's household; and a landlord may give notice to a person that the person is barred from the premises owned by the landlord.", "pending_committee_id": 235, "committee": {"committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2022-01-31", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, {"date": "2022-02-09", "committee_id": 3301, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Judiciary - Civil"}, {"date": "2022-02-18", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}], "history": [{"date": "2022-01-27", "action": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
