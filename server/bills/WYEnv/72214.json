Authorizes a public utility that generates dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity to apply to the commission for rate recovery of the cost of any carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology used to achieve the electricity generation standards provided that the carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology is integral or adjacent to a coal-fired generation facility (Sec. 1). Authorizes a public utility to apply to the commission for authorization to allow a portion of any revenues from the sale of carbon dioxide captured, stored, or utilized as a result of generating dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity to be returned to the shareholders of the public utility (Sec. 1). Authorizes a public utility to implement a rate recovery mechanism that collects a surcharge from customers up to 2 percent of each customer's total electric bill to provide for the recovery of the prudently incurred incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard (Sec. 1).c Defines “carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology” as technology that has the principal purpose of capturing, reusing, storing, sequestering, or using carbon dioxide emissions to prevent carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, whether constructed integral or adjacent to a coal-fired generation facility (Sec. 1). Defines “dispatchable” as a source of electricity that is available for use on-demand and that can be dispatched upon request of a power grid operator or that can have its power output adjusted according to market needs (Sec. 1). Defines “reliable” as meaning generated electricity that is not subject to intermittent availability (Sec. 1). Specifies that the provisions of this act will not apply to any public utility owned or operated by a municipality or any cooperative electrical generation and transmission association operating in interstate commerce (Sec. 2)."}
