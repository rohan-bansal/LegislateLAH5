Among other things, the bill does the following: removes marijuana from the list of scheduled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and eliminates criminal penalties for an individual who manufactures, distributes, or possesses marijuana; directs the Food and Drug Administration and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the Department of the Treasury to issue rules to regulate marijuana that are similar to the federal rules regulating alcohol; creates protections for depository institutions that provide financial services to marijuana-related businesses; creates protections for veterans who use, possess, or transport medical marijuana; and requires the National Institutes of Health to study and report on the effects of medical marijuana on individuals who are impaired or in pain and the relationship between state-approved treatment programs involving medical marijuana, access to such programs, and a reduction in opioid abuse.", "pending_committee_id":
