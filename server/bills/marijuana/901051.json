Creates a procedure by which an attorney for the Commonwealth or law-enforcement officer may apply to a circuit court judge for a warrant to remove firearms from a person who poses a substantial risk of injury to himself or others. If firearms are seized pursuant to such warrant, the bill requires a court hearing within 14 days from execution of the warrant to determine whether the firearms should be returned or retained by law enforcement. Seized firearms may be retained by court order for up to 180 days or, with court approval, may be transferred to a third party chosen by the person from whom they were seized. Persons who have been served with a warrant to remove firearms until such warrant has been dissolved by a court or who are the subject of an order to retain firearms are disqualified from having a concealed handgun permit or purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer and may not be employed by a licensed firearms dealer. The bill also provides that a person who transfers a firearm to a person he knows has been served with a warrant or who is the subject of an order is guilty of a Class 6 felony.", "pending_committee_id": 155, "committee": {"committee_id": 155, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Militia, Police and Public Safety"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-09", "committee_id": 155, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Militia, Police and Public Safety"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-09", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/17 17102461D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-09", "action": "Referred to Committee on Militia, Police and Public Safety", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-17", "action": "Assigned MPPS sub: #1", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-19", "action": "Subcommittee recommends laying on the table by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-02-07", "action": "Left in Militia, Police and Public Safety", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16261, "person_hash": "quifwl9y", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Richard Sullivan", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "C.", "last_name": "Sullivan", "suffix": "Jr.", "nickname": "Rip", "district": "HD-048", "ftm_eid": 5965912, "votesmart_id": 129034, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 510361, "ballotpedia": "R.C._Sullivan_Jr.", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 206, "subject_name": "Crimes and Offenses Generally"}, {"subject_id": 207, "subject_name": "Criminal Procedure"}, {"subject_id": 301, "subject_name": "Weapons"}, {"subject_id": 169203, "subject_name": "Firearms"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1447723, "date": "2017-01-09", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB1758/id/1447723", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+HB1758+hil", "text_size": 57378, "text_hash": "0cdb77828015df38960af216752ff9ca"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-19", "time": "00:00", "location": "8th Floor West Conference Room", "description": "House Militia, Police and Public Safety - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
