Expresses the sense of the Senate that: the use of illicit fentanyl in the United States and the resulting overdose deaths are a public health crisis; the trafficking of illicit fentanyl into the United States, especially by transnational criminal organizations, is a problem that requires close cooperation between the U.S. government and the governments of Mexico and China; and all three such countries have a shared interest in, and responsibility for, stopping the production of illicit fentanyl and its trafficking into the United States. Calls for the United States to: support the efforts by the governments of Mexico and China to stop such production and trafficking into the United States; take further measures to reduce and prevent heroin and fentanyl consumption through enhanced enforcement to reduce the illegal supply and increased use of evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery services; and use its broad diplomatic and law enforcement resources, in partnership with the governments of China and Mexico, to stop such production and trafficking.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2017-03-08", "committee_id": 2327, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Foreign Relations"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-03-08", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
