Decriminalizes simple marijuana possession and provides a civil penalty, payable to the Literary Fund, of no more than $100 for a first violation, $250 for a second violation, and $500 for a third or subsequent violation. Under current law, a first offense is punishable by a maximum fine of $500 and a maximum 30-day jail sentence, and subsequent offenses are a Class 1 misdemeanor. The bill reduces the criminal penalties for distribution and possession with intent to sell, give, or distribute marijuana. The bill creates a rebuttable presumption that a person who possesses no more than one ounce of marijuana possesses it for personal use and provides that the suspended sentence/substance abuse screening provisions apply only to criminal violations or to civil violations by a minor. The bill also limits forfeiture of property from the sale or distribution of marijuana to quantities of more than one pound; currently there is no minimum amount.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2019-12-30", "committee_id": 150, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-12-30", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/08/20 20101961D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-12-30", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2020-02-05", "action": "Incorporated by Courts of Justice ", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17732, "person_hash": "wvuqnac0", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Mark Levine", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "H.", "last_name": "Levine", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-045", "ftm_eid": 13981299, "votesmart_id": 152266, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 489443, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Levine_(Virginia)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 2, "type": "Similar To", "sast_bill_number": "HB972", "sast_bill_id": 1296854}], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2082559, "date": "2019-12-30", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB301/id/2082559", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+HB301+hil", "text_size": 67396, "text_hash": "5ac730747b2544610c51f420ccf7ca45"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2020-02-05", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Room 3", "description": "House Courts of Justice Committee Hearing"}]}}
