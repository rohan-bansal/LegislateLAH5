Allows a person to possess marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinol pursuant to a valid written certification issued by a physician for the treatment of any medical condition and allows a physician or pharmacist to distribute such substances without being subject to prosecution.

The bill requires that the person issued the written certification register with the Board of Pharmacy which will issue the person an identification card upon registration.
