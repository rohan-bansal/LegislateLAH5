Allows a Medical marijuana; written certification. Allows a person to possess marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinol pursuant to a valid written certification issued by a physician for the treatment of any medical condition deemed terminal or debilitating by a licensed health care professional, pain management, cancer, glaucoma, intractable epilepsy, human immunodeficiency virus, osteoporosis, or arthritis. The bill allows a physician or pharmacist to distribute such substances without being subject to prosecution. Under current law, a person has an affirmative defense to prosecution for possession of marijuana if the marijuana is in the form of cannabidiol oil or THC-A oil and the person has been issued a written certification by a physician that such marijuana is for the purposes of treating or alleviating the person's symptoms of intractable epilepsy. The bill expands the authority for a pharmaceutical processor, after obtaining a permit from the Board of Pharmacy and under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, to manufacture and provide marijuana in any form to be used for the treatment of any medical condition deemed terminal or debilitating by a licensed health care professional, pain management, cancer, glaucoma, intractable epilepsy, human immunodeficiency virus, osteoporosis, or arthritis, not just marijuana in the form of cannabidiol oil and THC-A oil to be used for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Finally, the bill clarifies that the penalties for forging or altering a written certification for medical marijuana or for making or uttering a false or forged written certification are the same as the penalties for committing the same", "pending_committee_id": 150, "committee": {"committee_id": 150, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Courts of Justice"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-09", "committee_id": 150, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-09", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/10/18 18103676D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-09", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-02-15", "action": "Left in Courts of Justice", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 19440, "person_hash": "yl6g82ws", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Elizabeth Guzman", "first_name": "Elizabeth", "middle_name": "R.", "last_name": "Guzman", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-031", "ftm_eid": 43620466, "votesmart_id": 176356, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 620436, "ballotpedia": "Elizabeth_Guzman", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1678129, "date": "2018-01-09", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB974/id/1678129", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+HB974+hil", "text_size": 28992, "text_hash": "802d140a8914a38ddbb3ce4bd91db663"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
