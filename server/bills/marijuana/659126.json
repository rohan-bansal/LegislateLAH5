Decriminalizes marijuana possession and changes the current $500 criminal fine for simple marijuana possession to a maximum $100 civil penalty payable to the Literary Fund and eliminates the 30-day jail sentence. The bill reduces the criminal penalties for distribution of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. The bill creates a rebuttable presumption that a person who grows no more than six marijuana plants does so only for personal use and not for distribution and provides that the suspended sentence/substance abuse screening provisions apply only to criminal violations or to civil violations by a minor. Marijuana is removed from a statute making it a Class 1 misdemeanor to distribute or display advertisements, etc., for instruments used for marijuana and from the common nuisance statute. The distribution of paraphernalia statute will apply only to an adult who distributes to a minor at least three years his junior. The bill also limits forfeiture of property from sale or distribution of marijuana to quantities of more than one pound; currently there is no minimum amount. The penalty for possession of marijuana by a prisoner is reduced from a Class 5 felony to a Class 6 felony.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2014-10-31", "committee_id": 162, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2014-10-31", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/14/15 15100820D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2014-10-31", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2015-01-28", "action": "Committee substitute printed to Web only 15104017D-S1", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2015-01-28", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Courts of Justice (9-Y 5-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 683, "person_hash": "gm46wrfb", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Adam Ebbin", "first_name": "Adam", "middle_name": "P.", "last_name": "Ebbin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-030", "ftm_eid": 6410921, "votesmart_id": 50868, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 221587, "ballotpedia": "Adam_Ebbin", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1050189, "date": "2014-10-31", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB686/id/1050189", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+SB686+hil", "text_size": 49185, "text_hash": "5c165ded62c3cffc9c5ddad01978f73b"}, {"doc_id": 1105293, "date": "2015-01-28", "type": "Comm Sub", "type_id": 2, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB686/id/1105293", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+SB686S1+hil", "text_size": 32880, "text_hash": "441614b2271603161cdc48c52d50df06"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 386907, "date": "2015-01-28", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Courts of Justice (9-Y 5-N)", "yea": 9, "nay": 5, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB686/id/386907", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+vot+S03V0104+SB0686"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
