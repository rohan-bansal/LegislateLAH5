Creates a procedure where an attorney for the Commonwealth or law-enforcement officer can apply to a circuit court judge for a warrant to remove firearms from a person who poses a substantial risk of injury to himself or others. If firearms are seized pursuant to the warrant, there will be a court hearing within 14 days from execution of the warrant to determine whether the firearms should be returned or retained by law-enforcement. Firearms may be retained for up to 180 days or, with court approval, may be transferred to a third party chosen by the person from whom they were seized. Persons who have been served with a warrant or who are the subject of an order are disqualified from having a concealed handgun permit or purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer and may not be employed by a licensed firearms dealer. It will also be a crime for a person to transfer a firearm to a person whom he knows has been served with a warrant or who is the subject of an order.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2015-01-23", "committee_id": 162, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-01-23", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 15102360D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2015-01-23", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2015-01-26", "action": "Failed to report (defeated) in Courts of Justice (4-Y 10-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 761, "person_hash": "lj342nsh", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "George Barker", "first_name": "George", "middle_name": "Lincoln", "last_name": "Barker", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-039", "ftm_eid": 6484200, "votesmart_id": 69989, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 260398, "ballotpedia": "George_Barker", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1088862, "date": "2015-01-23", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1429/id/1088862", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+SB1429+hil", "text_size": 51563, "text_hash": "84f7284c0b0ccea47e65f64625460292"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 385865, "date": "2015-01-26", "desc": "Senate: Failed to report (defeated) in Courts of Justice (4-Y 10-N)", "yea": 4, "nay": 10, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 0, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB1429/id/385865", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+vot+S03V0101+SB1429"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
