Decriminalizes marijuana possession and provides a civil penalty of no more than $250 for a first violation and $1,000 for a second or subsequent violation. Under current law, a first offense is punishable by a maximum fine of $500 and a maximum 30-day jail sentence, and subsequent offenses are a Class 1 misdemeanor. The bill creates a rebuttable presumption that a person who possesses no more than one-half ounce of marijuana possesses it for personal use and provides that the existing suspended sentence and substance abuse screening provisions apply only to criminal violations or to civil violations by a minor. The bill decreases the penalty for distribution or possession with intent to sell more than one-half but not more than five pounds of marijuana from a Class 5 felony to a Class 6 felony.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2016-12-27", "committee_id": 162, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-12-27", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/17 17102423D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-12-27", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-23", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Courts of Justice with letter (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 773, "person_hash": "7rn4k1kk", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Louise Lucas", "first_name": "L.
