Creates a procedure by which an attorney for the Commonwealth or law-enforcement officer may apply to a circuit court judge for a warrant to remove firearms from a person who poses a substantial risk of injury to himself or others. If firearms are seized pursuant to such warrant, the bill requires a court hearing within 14 days from execution of the warrant to determine whether the firearms should be returned or retained by law enforcement. Seized firearms may be retained by court order for up to 180 days or, with court approval, may be transferred to a third party chosen by the person from whom they were seized. Persons who have been served with a warrant to remove firearms until such warrant has been dissolved by a court or who are the subject of an order to retain firearms are guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor for purchasing, possessing, or transporting a firearm; are disqualified from having a concealed handgun permit; and may not be employed by a licensed firearms dealer. The bill also provides that a person who transfers a firearm to a person he knows has been served with a warrant or who is the subject of an order is guilty of a Class 6 felony.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-05", "committee_id": 162, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-05", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/10/18 18103481D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-05", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-01-15", "action": "Failed to report (defeated) in Courts of Justice (6-Y 9-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 761, "person_hash": "lj342nsh", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "George Barker", "first_name": "George", "middle_name": "Lincoln", "last_name": "Barker", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-039", "ftm_eid": 6484200, "votesmart_id": 69989, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 260398, "ballotpedia": "George_Barker", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1677339, "date": "2018-01-05", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB276/id/1677339", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+SB276+hil", "text_size": 58435, "text_hash": "6dd8a7f3e465d8445f2abb06e7fc3d4d"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 685153, "date": "2018-01-15", "desc": "Senate: Failed to report (defeated) in Courts of Justice (6-Y 9-N)", "yea": 6, "nay": 9, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 0, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB276/id/685153", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+S03V0041+SB0276"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-01-15", "time": "08:00", "location": "Senate Committee Room, Pocahontas Building", "description": "Senate Committee on Courts of Justice Hearing"}]}}
