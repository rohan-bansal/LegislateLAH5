Specifically, the bill (1) reauthorizes grants that are available through the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) for community-based coalitions to address local drug crises, and (2) authorizes new grants for coalitions to implement education and prevention strategies in communities that face significant levels of drug overdoses related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. The ONDCP may delegate authority to execute the new grants to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must carry out a campaign to increase public awareness of the dangers of fentanyl, including the risk of fentanyl contamination in counterfeit drugs. The bill also establishes an interagency work group to coordinate and improve federal efforts to reduce and prevent overdoses involving fentanyl contamination in illegal drugs. Work group members include the ONDCP, HHS, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State.", "pending_committee_id": 2328, "committee": {"committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2022-06-08", "committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}], "history": [{"date": "2022-06-08", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9491, "person_hash": "isieh7x3", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Lisa Murkowski", "first_name": "Lisa", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Murkowski", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-AK", "ftm_eid": 6604204, "votesmart_id": 15841, "opensecrets_id": "N00026050", "knowwho_pid": 192554, "ballotpedia": "Lisa_Murkowski", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9423, "person_hash": "mswz9g79", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Dianne Feinstein", "first_name": "Dianne", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Feinstein", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CA", "ftm_eid": 26294, "votesmart_id": 53273, "opensecrets_id": "N00007364", "knowwho_pid": 165201, "ballotpedia": "Dianne_Feinstein", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 18486, "person_hash": "8009qp8o", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Margaret Hassan", "first_name": "Margaret", "middle_name": "Wood", "last_name": "Hassan", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-NH", "ftm_eid": 9693318, "votesmart_id": 42552, "opensecrets_id": "N00038397", "knowwho_pid": 227982, "ballotpedia": "Maggie_Hassan", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 16523, "person_hash": "urkh79kr", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Dan Sullivan", "first_name": "Dan", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Sullivan", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-AK", "ftm_eid": 39833727, "votesmart_id": 114964, "opensecrets_id": "N00035774", "knowwho_pid": 328336, "ballotpedia": "Daniel_S._Sullivan", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13304, "subject_name": "Health"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2596708, "date": "2022-06-16", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB4358/id/2596708", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/s4358/BILLS-117s4358is.pdf", "text_size": 244787, "text_hash": "788f3a4ce78277eee2d724d231c7e05a"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
