Decriminalizes simple marijuana possession and provides a civil penalty of no more than $100 for a first violation, $250 for a second violation, and $500 for a third or subsequent violation. Under current law there is a maximum fine of $500 and a maximum 30-day jail sentence for a first offense and subsequent offenses are a Class 1 misdemeanor. The bill reduces the criminal penalties for distribution and possession with intent to distribute, etc., of marijuana. The bill creates a rebuttable presumption that a person who possesses no more than one ounce of marijuana possesses it for personal use and provides that the suspended sentence/substance abuse screening provisions apply only to criminal violations or to civil violations by a minor. The bill also limits forfeiture of property from sale or distribution of marijuana to quantities of more than one pound; currently there is no minimum amount.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2015-12-23", "committee_id": 162, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-12-23", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/16 16100351D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2015-12-23", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-02-03", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Courts of Justice (11-Y 4-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 683, "person_hash": "gm46wrfb", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Adam Ebbin", "first_name": "Adam", "middle_name": "P.", "last_name": "Ebbin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-030", "ftm_eid": 6410921, "votesmart_id": 50868, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 221587, "ballotpedia": "Adam_Ebbin", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1279953, "date": "2015-12-23", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB104/id/1279953", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+SB104+hil", "text_size": 50542, "text_hash": "c135465e9d38a4e624d0102e033d9291"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 490842, "date": "2016-02-03", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Courts of Justice (11-Y 4-N)", "yea": 11, "nay": 4, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB104/id/490842", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+vot+S03V0166+SB0104"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2016-02-03", "time": "00:00", "location": "Senate Room B", "description": "Senate Committee on Courts of Justice Hearing"}]}}
