The bill requires the Board to establish a ratio of one pharmacist for every six pharmacy interns, technicians, and technician trainees for pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities. The bill directs the Board of Pharmacy to require that, after processing and before dispensing cannabis oil, a pharmaceutical processor make a sample available from each homogenized batch of product for testing at an independent laboratory located in Virginia that meets Board requirements. The bill requires that the Board promulgate regulations that include an allowance for the sale of devices for administration of dispensed products and an allowance for the use and distribution of inert product samples containing no cannabinoids for patient demonstration exclusively at the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility, and not for further distribution or sale, without the need for a written certification. The bill also requires the Board to adopt regulations for pharmaceutical processors that include requirements for (i) processes for safely and securely cultivating cannabis plants intended for producing cannabis oil; (ii) a maximum number of marijuana plants a pharmaceutical processor may possess at any one time; (iii) the secure disposal of plant remains; (iv) dosage limitations, which shall provide that each dispensed dose of cannabis oil not exceed 10 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol; and (v) a process for registering cannabis oil products.
