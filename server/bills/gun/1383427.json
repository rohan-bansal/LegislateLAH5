Establishes the Violence Intervention and Prevention Fund (the Fund), to be administered by the Department of Criminal Justice Services (the Department), to distribute grants to localities and organizations for the purpose of improving public health and safety by supporting effective violence reduction initiatives in communities that are disproportionately impacted by violence, particularly homicides, shootings, and aggravated assaults. Funds may also be used to finance the hiring of counselors in public elementary and secondary schools and research initiatives that have the objective of reducing gun violence.   The bill provides that the Department shall issue grants on a competitive basis. As a condition of receiving a grant, a locality or organization must commit a cash or in-kind contribution equivalent to the amount of the grant, with waivers allowed for good cause, and report on its progress toward achieving the grant's objectives. The bill requires the Department to provide public access to such reports.   The bill imposes a 15 percent tax on the sale of any firearm or ammunition, with all revenue from the tax accruing to the Fund. Sales to state or local agencies or law-enforcement officers are exempt from the tax.", "pending_committee_id": 152, "committee": {"committee_id": 152, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2020-01-17", "committee_id": 152, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Finance"}, {"date": "2020-01-29", "committee_id": 3869, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Finance: Subcommittee #3"}, {"date": "2020-02-05", "committee_id": 152, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2020-01-17", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 20100209D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-01-17", "action": "Referred to Committee on Finance", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2020-01-29", "action": "Assigned Finance sub: Subcommittee #3", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-01-31", "action": "Subcommittee recommends continuing to 2021 by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-02-05", "action": "Continued to 2021 in Finance by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-12-04", "action": "Left in Finance", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16093, "person_hash": "ghkk9r3a", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Sam Rasoul", "first_name": "Sam", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Rasoul", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-011", "ftm_eid": 19875124, "votesmart_id": 109345, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 267157, "ballotpedia": "Sam_Rasoul", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 9, "type": "Carry Over", "sast_bill_number": "HB1687", "sast_bill_id": 1313727}], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2216606, "date": "2020-01-17", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB1687/id/2216606", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+ful+HB1687+hil", "text_size": 10489, "text_hash": "73a45e5e998aa509bb3ec50020d15b91"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
