Requires any person registered to possess a machine gun to notify the Department of State Police (the Department) of a change of address within 30 days of such change. The bill reduces the number of photographs that an applicant for a nonresident concealed handgun permit must submit from two to one. The bill requires the form provided by the Department for a dealer to obtain criminal history record information for a firearm purchase to include a question about whether the proposed purchaser has been the subject of a temporary detention order and subsequently agreed to voluntary admission to a state facility. Current law prohibits such persons from purchasing, possessing, or transporting a firearm and provides that other mental health disqualifications be disclosed on such form. The bill requires firearms dealers to comply with the federal minimum wait time of three days after contacting the system for a background check before releasing a firearm without an approval number; under existing state law, such firearm must be released after one business day without an approval number. The bill removes the option under state law for a dealer to complete a sale if notified that a response will not be available by the end of the dealer's next business day and removes the requirement that the Department notify the dealer of such delay. The bill removes the requirement that the dealer mail the criminal history record check consent form for a person who is", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-05", "committee_id": 162, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Courts of Justice"}, {"date": "2017-01-18", "committee_id": 164, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Finance and Appropriations"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-05", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/17 17101615D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-05", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-18", "action": "Committee substitute printed 17104448D-S1", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-18", "action": "Reported from Courts of Justice with substitute (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-18", "action": "Rereferred to Finance", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-31", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Finance (16-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 766, "person_hash": "ib2vxbt5", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Edwards", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Edwards", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-021", "ftm_eid": 13013704, "votesmart_id": 8263, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199403, "ballotpedia": "John_Edwards,_Virginia_Senator", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 178, "subject_name": "Appropriations"}, {"subject_id": 189, "subject_name": "Civil Remedies and Procedure"}, {"subject_id": 206, "subject_name": "Crimes and Offenses Generally"}, {"subject_id": 301, "subject_name": "Weapons"}, {"subject_id": 169190, "subject_name": "Criminal History Information"}, {"subject_id": 169203, "subject_name": "Firearms"}, {"subject_id": 169273, "subject_name": "Concealed Weapons"}, {"subject_id": 169274, "subject_name": "Handguns"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1447863, "date": "2017-01-05", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1049/id/1447863", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+SB1049+hil", "text_size": 32597, "text_hash": "ecc433ffa3ccefc924cf4b94ab045e17"}, {"doc_id": 1468036, "date": "2017-01-18", "type": "Comm Sub", "type_id": 2, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1049/id/1468036", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+SB1049S1+hil", "text_size": 29179, "text_hash": "e55f91cebbbc73281515e3f650159045"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 568545, "date": "2017-01-18", "desc": "Senate: Reported from Courts of Justice with substitute (15-Y 0-N)", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB1049/id/568545", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+vot+S03V0061+SB1049"}, {"roll_call_id": 573702, "date": "2017-01-31", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Finance (16-Y 0-N)", "yea": 16, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 16, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB1049/id/573702", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+vot+S05V0145+SB1049"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-18", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Courts of Justice Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-18", "time": "00:00", "location": "Senate Room B", "description": "Senate Committee on Courts of Justice Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-31", "time": "09:00", "location": "Senate Room B", "description": "Senate Committee on Finance Hearing"}]}}
