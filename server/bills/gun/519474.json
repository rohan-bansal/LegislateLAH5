Requires a gun dealer participating in the program to: (1) pay an individual 125% of a gun's market value, as determined by the Director; and (2) deliver guns received to the closest Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [ATF] office (for grantees) or to the state or local government (for subgrantees) within 60 days of receipt.
