The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to expand research on violence associated with mental illness and substance abuse disorders. It requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand the National Violent Death Reporting System to all 50 states and to research the causes, mechanisms, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries from gun violence. The bill states that no provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prohibits physicians from asking patients about guns in their homes, speaking to a patient about gun safety, or reporting a patient's threat of violence. It amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to specify that the term \"committed to a mental institution\" applies to involuntary inpatient or outpatient treatment. The bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to states to remove firearms from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others. DOJ must promptly notify law enforcement agencies when a prohibited person attempts to purchase a firearm. The bill replaces statutory references to persons \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" with persons \"adjudicated as ineligible due to disqualifying mental status.\" It amends the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 to: establish procedures to restore firearm ownership rights after a mental health adjudication or commitment, require an annual report on record submissions due to domestic violence misdemeanor convictions, authorize state grants to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health and criminal history records, and require quarterly updates to federal agency record submissions. The bill reauthorizes the National Criminal History Records Improvement Program for FY2016-FY2019.", "pending_committee_id": 2330, "committee": {"committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2015-07-09", "committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-07-09", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11199, "person_hash": "crmbr7rg", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Richard Blumenthal", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Blumenthal", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CT", "ftm_eid": 6378136, "votesmart_id": 1568, "opensecrets_id": "N00031685", "knowwho_pid": 218586, "ballotpedia": "Richard_Blumenthal", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB2994", "sast_bill_id": 787139}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB731", "sast_bill_id": 712567}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB1211", "sast_bill_id": 743960}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB1588", "sast_bill_id": 785781}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB2192", "sast_bill_id": 795791}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB3926", "sast_bill_id": 796524}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13384, "subject_name": "Administrative remedies"}, {"subject_id": 13781, "subject_name": "Assault and harassment offenses"}, {"subject_id": 13141, "subject_name": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"}, {"subject_id": 13142, "subject_name": "Child health"}, {"subject_id": 13433, "subject_name": "Correctional facilities and imprisonment"}, {"subject_id": 13374, "subject_name": "Criminal justice information and records"}, {"subject_id": 13156, "subject_name": "Department of Health and Human Services"}, {"subject_id": 13660, "subject_name": "Domestic violence and child abuse"}, {"subject_id": 13307, "subject_name": "Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"}, {"subject_id": 13171, "subject_name": "Education programs funding"}, {"subject_id": 13174, "subject_name": "Elementary and secondary education"}, {"subject_id": 13308, "subject_name": "Emergency medical services and trauma care"}, {"subject_id": 13467, "subject_name": "Evidence and witnesses"}, {"subject_id": 13341, "subject_name": "Firearms and explosives"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 13207, "subject_name": "Health care coverage and access"}, {"subject_id": 13210, "subject_name": "Health information and medical records"}, {"subject_id": 13211, "subject_name": "Health personnel"}, {"subject_id": 13212, "subject_name": "Health programs administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13213, "subject_name": "Health promotion and preventive care"}, {"subject_id": 13231, "subject_name": "Intergovernmental relations"}, {"subject_id": 13656, "subject_name": "Juvenile crime and gang violence"}, {"subject_id": 13236, "subject_name": "Law enforcement administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13469, "subject_name": "Law enforcement officers"}, {"subject_id": 13507, "subject_name": "Medical ethics"}, {"subject_id": 13241, "subject_name": "Medical research"}, {"subject_id": 13313, "subject_name": "Medical tests and diagnostic methods"}, {"subject_id": 13314, "subject_name": "Mental health"}, {"subject_id": 13258, "subject_name": "Performance measurement"}, {"subject_id": 13267, "subject_name": "Research administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13523, "subject_name": "Retail and wholesale trades"}, {"subject_id": 13270, "subject_name": "Right of privacy"}, {"subject_id": 13762, "subject_name": "Specialized courts"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}, {"subject_id": 13287, "subject_name": "Teaching, teachers, curricula"}, {"subject_id": 13295, "subject_name": "Veterans' medical care"}, {"subject_id": 13343, "subject_name": "Violent crime"}, {"subject_id": 13406, "subject_name": "Crime victims"}, {"subject_id": 13640, "subject_name": "Product safety and quality"}, {"subject_id": 13340, "subject_name": "Crime and law enforcement"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1255461, "date": "2015-07-14", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1738/id/1255461", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s1738/BILLS-114s1738is.pdf", "text_size": 339012, "text_hash": "59b30a1a228820ef1502b011afe3126d"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
