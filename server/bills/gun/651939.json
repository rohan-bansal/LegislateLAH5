Requires: (1) a court issuing such an order and warrant to hold a hearing within 14 days to determine whether the individual who is the subject of the order may own, purchase, possess, or receive firearms and whether any seized firearms should be returned; (2) the state or petitioner to establish probable cause that the individual poses a significant risk of personal injury to the individual or others by owning or possessing the firearm; (3) the individual to be prohibited from possessing a firearm for up to one year if he or she is found to pose a significant threat; and (4) the firearm to be returned if the court finds that the state has not met the required standard of proof. Authorizes a law enforcement agency to seek renewal of an order if it has probable cause to believe the individual continues to pose a threat.  Amends the federal criminal court to prohibit: (1) the sale or disposition of a firearm or ammunition to anyone subject to such an order; and (2) any person subject to such an order from owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving any firearms.", "pending_committee_id": 2330, "committee": {"committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2014-06-05", "committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2014-06-05", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9401, "person_hash": "528jrj6c", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Barbara Boxer", "first_name": "Barbara", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Boxer", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CA", "ftm_eid": 2545581, "votesmart_id": 53274, "opensecrets_id": "N00006692", "knowwho_pid": 165202, "ballotpedia": "Barbara_Boxer", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 11199, "person_hash": "crmbr7rg", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Richard Blumenthal", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Blumenthal", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CT", "ftm_eid": 6378136, "votesmart_id": 1568, "opensecrets_id": "N00031685", "knowwho_pid": 218586, "ballotpedia": "Richard_Blumenthal", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9423, "person_hash": "mswz9g79", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Dianne Feinstein", "first_name": "Dianne", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Feinstein", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-CA", "ftm_eid": 26294, "votesmart_id": 53273, "opensecrets_id": "N00007364", "knowwho_pid": 165201, "ballotpedia": "Dianne_Feinstein", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "HB4806", "sast_bill_id": 651943}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13429, "subject_name": "Crime prevention"}, {"subject_id": 13374, "subject_name": "Criminal justice information and records"}, {"subject_id": 13341, "subject_name": "Firearms and explosives"}, {"subject_id": 13236, "subject_name": "Law enforcement administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}, {"subject_id": 13343, "subject_name": "Violent crime"}, {"subject_id": 13340, "subject_name": "Crime and law enforcement"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1033331, "date": "2014-06-09", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB2445/id/1033331", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/s2445/BILLS-113s2445is.pdf", "text_size": 274590, "text_hash": "60d481edf1e78a8d08bc0934a72f77c6"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
