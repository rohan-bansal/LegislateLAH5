Amends the CPSIA to prohibit a toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm from being manufactured, entered into commerce, shipped, transported, or received unless it contains, or has affixed to it, a marking approved by the CPSC. Maintains existing standards that require such firearms, subject to regulatory exceptions, to have a blaze orange plug inserted in their barrels. Sets forth exceptions that: (1) authorize the CPSC to provide for alternative markings or devices, or (2) require former Commerce regulations concerning approved markings to be considered approved by the CPSC in the absence of any CPSC regulations. Expands the categories of look-alike firearms subject to such marking requirements and regulations to include product cases or covers that have the appearance, shape, or configuration of a firearm. Repeals Commerce's authorities for approving alternative markings and penalizing violations. Requires violations to instead be treated under the CPSIA.", "pending_committee_id": 2359, "committee": {"committee_id": 2359, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2015-07-27", "committee_id": 2302, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Energy And Commerce"}, {"date": "2015-07-31", "committee_id": 2359, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-07-27", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2015-07-27", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2015-07-31", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 8970, "person_hash": "7kmcyqxq", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Eliot Engel", "first_name": "Eliot", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "Engel", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-NY-16", "ftm_eid": 17658812, "votesmart_id": 26972, "opensecrets_id": "N00001003", "knowwho_pid": 158986, "ballotpedia": "Eliot_Engel", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9051, "person_hash": "x4hkzhov", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Raul Grijalva", "first_name": "Raul", "middle_name": "M.", "last_name": "Grijalva", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-AZ-3", "ftm_eid": 17657668, "votesmart_id": 28253, "opensecrets_id": "N00025284", "knowwho_pid": 211719, "ballotpedia": "Raul_Grijalva", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9086, "person_hash": "1ztgbts1", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Carolyn Maloney", "first_name": "Carolyn", "middle_name": "B.", "last_name": "Maloney", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-NY-12", "ftm_eid": 17658243, "votesmart_id": 26978, "opensecrets_id": "N00000078", "knowwho_pid": 158983, "ballotpedia": "Carolyn_Maloney", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB213", "sast_bill_id": 691304}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13126, "subject_name": "Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}, {"subject_id": 13638, "subject_name": "Consumer Product Safety Commission"}, {"subject_id": 13147, "subject_name": "Consumer affairs"}, {"subject_id": 13152, "subject_name": "Department of Commerce"}, {"subject_id": 13185, "subject_name": "Federal preemption"}, {"subject_id": 13341, "subject_name": "Firearms and explosives"}, {"subject_id": 13701, "subject_name": "Manufacturing"}, {"subject_id": 13640, "subject_name": "Product safety and quality"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}, {"subject_id": 13637, "subject_name": "Commerce"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1257000, "date": "2015-07-29", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB3224/id/1257000", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr3224/BILLS-114hr3224ih.pdf", "text_size": 251885, "text_hash": "ea3b5484ee0a5b85658363e9ddaaab6a"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
