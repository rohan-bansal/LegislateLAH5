It authorizes the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to hire at least 50 additional personnel to carry out the additional inspections. It increases to five years the term of imprisonment for knowingly making a false statement or representation in required firearms records. It authorizes up to 10 years' imprisonment for: (1) providing false statements or identification related to the sale or other disposition of a firearm or ammunition, or (2) selling or otherwise disposing of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person is prohibited from possessing a firearm. The bill authorizes DOJ to suspend a firearms license or subject a licensee to a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for willfully violating firearms requirements or failing to have secure storage or safety devices available at any place firearms are sold to non-licensees (current law authorizes only license revocation). It permits a licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector who is indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to continue to operate under the license until the date of any conviction pursuant to the indictment (currently, until any conviction pursuant to the indictment becomes final).", "pending_committee_id": 2849, "committee": {"committee_id": 2849, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, And Investigations"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2016-01-08", "committee_id": 2309, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Judiciary"}, {"date": "2016-02-03", "committee_id": 2849, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, And Investigations"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-01-08", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-01-08", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-02-03", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9075, "person_hash": "i5ao9u95", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "James Langevin", "first_name": "James", "middle_name": "R.", "last_name": "Langevin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-RI-2", "ftm_eid": 5029414, "votesmart_id": 55787, "opensecrets_id": "N00009724", "knowwho_pid": 207711, "ballotpedia": "Jim_Langevin", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13413, "subject_name": "Business records"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13374, "subject_name": "Criminal justice information and records"}, {"subject_id": 13344, "subject_name": "Criminal procedure and sentencing"}, {"subject_id": 13159, "subject_name": "Department of Justice"}, {"subject_id": 13341, "subject_name": "Firearms and explosives"}, {"subject_id": 13198, "subject_name": "Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"}, {"subject_id": 13312, "subject_name": "Licensing and registrations"}, {"subject_id": 13523, "subject_name": "Retail and wholesale trades"}, {"subject_id": 13340, "subject_name": "Crime and law enforcement"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1290150, "date": "2016-01-09", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB4356/id/1290150", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr4356/BILLS-114hr4356ih.pdf", "text_size": 251829, "text_hash": "6db4813a9bd4d37fc0b3a53d2140d5f8"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
