Current law makes it a crime for any person to knowingly sell or transfer a firearm to a prohibited person (i.e., a person who is prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm). This legislation eliminates the \"knowingly\" standard to impose criminal liability on any person who sells or transfers a firearm to a prohibited person, regardless of whether such seller or transferor knows that the buyer is a prohibited person. A defendant seller or transferor may assert as an affirmative defense against prosecution evidence to prove that the buyer or recipient passed a background check or possessed a valid concealed carry permit in the state of transfer. The affirmative defense does not apply if defendant knew or had reasonable cause to believe the buyer or recipient was a prohibited person.", "pending_committee_id": 2309, "committee": {"committee_id": 2309, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2018-12-12", "committee_id": 2309, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-12-12", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-12-12", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16488, "person_hash": "g9uiscjq", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Don Beyer", "first_name": "Don", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Beyer", "suffix": "Jr.", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-VA-8", "ftm_eid": 1579842, "votesmart_id": 1707, "opensecrets_id": "N00036018", "knowwho_pid": 487540, "ballotpedia": "Don_Beyer", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13340, "subject_name": "Crime and law enforcement"}, {"subject_id": 13373, "subject_name": "Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"}, {"subject_id": 13374, "subject_name": "Criminal justice information and records"}, {"subject_id": 13341, "subject_name": "Firearms and explosives"}, {"subject_id": 13312, "subject_name": "Licensing and registrations"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1830554, "date": "2018-12-15", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB7274/id/1830554", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr7274/BILLS-115hr7274ih.pdf", "text_size": 245350, "text_hash": "fad047a4fcd76fb33dece7f3d5de2482"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
