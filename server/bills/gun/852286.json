Provides that a court may issue a gun violence restraining order if the petition, supported by an affidavit made in writing and signed by the petitioner under oath, or an oral statement, and any additional information provided to the court that shows that there is a substantial likelihood that both of the following are true: (1) the subject of the petition poses a clear and present danger of personal injury to himself, herself, or another by having in his or her custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm; and (2) a gun violence restraining order is necessary to prevent personal injury to the subject of the petition or another because less restrictive alternatives either have been tried and found to be ineffective, or are inadequate or inappropriate for the circumstances of the subject of the petition.
