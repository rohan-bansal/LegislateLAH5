The Fund will be funded by an additional penalty of $15 to be levied upon individuals convicted of crimes or offenses, thus ensuring that violators bear the cost of this initiative. The first $2.25 million of the Fund will go to the Department of Safety and Homeland Security to fight violent crime. The next $1 million will be administered by The Fund to Combat Violent Crimes Committee and distributed to local law enforcement agencies in connection with initiatives to reduce violent crime, especially gun violence. Local police agencies will apply for such funds. The next $1 million will be distributed to local law enforcement agencies. Any monies received in excess of $4.25 million per year will be deposited in the General Fund.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2011-05-26", "committee_id": 1663, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 25, "name": "Public Safety & Homeland Security"}, {"date": "2011-06-23", "committee_id": 1690, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 26, "name": "Revenue & Taxation"}], "history": [{"date": "2011-05-26", "action": "Introduced and Assigned to Public Safety & Homeland Security Committee in House", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-06-09", "action": "Substituted by HS 1 for HB 143", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-06-09", "action": "HS 1 for HB 143 - Assigned to Public Safety & Homeland Security", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-06-15", "action": "HS 1 for HB 143 - Reported Out of Committee (PUBLIC SAFETY & HOMELAND SECURITY) in House with 9 On Its Merits", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-06-16", "action": "HS 1 for HB 143 - Amendment HA 1 - Introduced in House", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-06-16", "action": "HS 1 for HB 143 - Amendment HA 1 - Passed in House by Voice Vote", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-06-16", "action": "HS 1 for HB 143 - Passed by House of Representatives.
