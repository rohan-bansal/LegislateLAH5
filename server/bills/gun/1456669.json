Adds bullying and the death of a family member as mitigating factors that a student may disclose during a suspension review hearing or expulsion hearing. If allegations of sexual violence or gender-based harassment (rather than only allegations of domestic violence) are made against the student subject to discipline during the suspension review hearing or expulsion hearing, prohibits the student subject to discipline or the student's representative from directly questioning or contacting the alleged victim. If a pupil will be absent from school for 2 or more consecutive weeks for treatment of the pupil's physical or mental health arising from domestic or sexual violence, requires a qualified employee (rather than an employee) from the pupil's domestic or sexual violence organization to provide written notice of the pupil's need for home instruction to the school district; defines \"qualified employee\", \"domestic violence program\", and \"rape crises organization\". Amends the Children and Students Who Are Parents, Expectant Parents, or Victims of Domestic or Sexual Violence Article of the School Code. Requires the Ensuring Success in School Task Force to include in its report recommendations for language to include in school and district policies (rather than to include model school and district policies in the report). Changes the date of the Task Force's report to January 1, 2024 (rather than June 30, 2024); repeals the provisions related to the Task Force on December 1, 2024 (rather than December 1, 2025). Makes other changes to the provisions concerning the review and revision of school district policies and procedures. Amends provisions concerning confidentiality. Sets forth additional requirements a school district must include in its policy concerning student confidentiality and the disclosure of information related to the imminent risk of serious physical injury or death of a student or another person. Makes other changes. Effective July 1, 2022, except that provisions concerning confidentiality take effect July 1, 2023.", "pending_committee_id": 235, "committee": {"committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-02-19", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, {"date": "2021-03-16", "committee_id": 3300, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Elementary & Secondary Education: School Curriculum & Policies"}, {"date": "2021-05-10", "committee_id": 254, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Assignments"}, {"date": "2021-05-10", "committee_id": 267, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Executive"}, {"date": "2021-05-26", "committee_id": 254, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Assignments"}, {"date": "2021-05-26", "committee_id": 267, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Executive"}, {"date": "2021-06-15", "committee_id": 254, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Assignments"}, {"date": "2021-10-19", "committee_id": 263, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Education"}, {"date": "2021-10-19", "committee_id": 254, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Assignments"}, {"date": "2021-10-25", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, {"date": "2021-10-25", "committee_id": 3300, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Elementary & Secondary Education: School Curriculum & Policies"}, {"date": "2021-11-29", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}, {"date": "2022-02-09", "committee_id": 3300, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Elementary & Secondary Education: School Curriculum & Policies"}, {"date": "2022-05-09", "committee_id": 235, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 35, "name": "Rules"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-02-18", "action": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
