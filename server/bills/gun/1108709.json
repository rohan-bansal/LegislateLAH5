Provides that a circuit court may issue a warrant to search for and seize a firearm in the possession of a person who is believed to pose a clear and present danger to himself, herself, or to others if: (1) a law enforcement officer provides the court a sworn affidavit; (2) the affidavit specifically describes the location of the firearm; and (3) the circuit court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the person poses a clear and present danger to himself, herself, or others and is in possession of a firearm. Provides that if a law enforcement officer seizes a firearm from a person whom the law enforcement officer believes to pose a clear and present danger to himself, herself, or to others without obtaining a warrant, the law enforcement officer shall submit to the circuit court having jurisdiction over the person believed to pose a clear and present danger to himself, herself, or to others, a written statement under oath or affirmation describing the basis for the law enforcement officer's belief that the person poses a clear and present danger to himself, herself, or to others. Provides that not later than 14 days after a return is filed or a written statement is submitted, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the seized firearm should be: (1) returned to the person from whom the firearm was seized; or (2) retained by the law enforcement agency having custody of the firearm. Repeals the Firearm Seizure Act on January 1, 2019. Makes other changes.
