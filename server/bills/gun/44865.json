This bill also prohibits new home care organizations from being licensed until July 1, 2012, but allows the Commissioner of Health to issue a request for and accept applications for: (i) the establishment of home care organizations in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas or (ii) home care organizations approved for payments for home health or personal care services by
