Requires the department, before submitting a proposed measure or other proposed action to the General Assembly pursuant to the previous highlight, to (Sec. 5): Submit to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin the proposed measure or other proposed action that is in the form of draft legislation, with a public comment period of no less than 180 days; Conduct a minimum of 4 public hearings on the proposed measure or other proposed action during the public comment period, and conduct the hearings in geographically dispersed locations in the state, including locations in which regulated sources of carbon dioxide emissions would be directly economically affected by the proposal; and Following the public comment period, compile a report to be submitted to both standing committees following the public comment period that must include: A list of all individual facilities, by county, that would be subject to the proposed measure or other proposed action; A summary of the impacts on all industries whose public testimony or comments were received by the department during the public comment period; An estimate of the net carbon dioxide emission reductions that the proposed measure or other proposed action would engender within the PJM Interconnection region, taking into account the electricity generation in neighboring states where there is not a regulation or tax on carbon dioxide emissions; A summary and justification of any provisions in the proposed measure or other proposed action that would address leakage; A description of the economic and fiscal impacts that would result from the proposed measure or other proposed action; and Whether a less costly or less intrusive alternative method of achieving the goal of the proposed measure or other proposed action has been considered for an employer or facility that would otherwise be subject to the proposed measure or proposed action.
