The General Assembly further finds that State investment in the clean energy economy in Illinois can be a vehicle for expanding equitable access to public health, safety, a cleaner environment, quality jobs, and economic opportunity (Sec. 5-10). Requires the Energy Transition Workforce Commission to produce an Energy Transition Workforce Report regarding the anticipated impact of the energy transition and a comprehensive set of recommendations to address changes to the Illinois workforce from 2020 through 2050, or a later year. The report will contain the following elements, designed to be used for the programs created in this Act (Sec. 10-15.d): Information related to the impact on current workers; Information regarding the impact on communities and local governments; and Information on emerging industries and State economic development opportunities in regions that have historically been the site of fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power plants, or coal mining.
