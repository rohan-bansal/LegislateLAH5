The term \"born alive\" means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut. Also, a health care practitioner or other employee who has knowledge of a failure to comply with these requirements must immediately report such failure to an appropriate law enforcement agency. An individual who violates the provisions of this Act is subject to a criminal fine, up to five years in prison, or both. An individual who commits an overt act that kills a child born alive is subject to criminal prosecution for murder. The legislation bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate the provisions of this Act, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of felony. A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this Act.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2015-06-17", "committee_id": 2329, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}, {"date": "2015-09-10", "committee_id": 2306, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Homeland Security"}, {"date": "2015-09-14", "committee_id": 2544, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-06-17", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2015-06-24", "action": "Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
