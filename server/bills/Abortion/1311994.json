Creates the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The Act prohibits an abortion after 20 weeks gestation unless, in reasonable medical judgment, the mother has a condition that so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the abortion to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function. When an abortion is not prohibited post-20 weeks' gestation, the physician is required to terminate the pregnancy in a manner that would provide the unborn child the best opportunity to survive. The bill punishes performance of an abortion in violation of the Act as a Class 6 felony. The bill also provides for civil remedies against a physician who performs an abortion in violation of the Act.", "pending_committee_id": 163, "committee": {"committee_id": 163, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Education and Health"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2020-01-16", "committee_id": 163, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Education and Health"}], "history": [{"date": "2020-01-16", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 20105225D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-01-16", "action": "Referred to Committee on Education and Health", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2020-02-12", "action": "Left in Education and Health", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17747, "person_hash": "20byu1wu", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Amanda Chase", "first_name": "Amanda", "middle_name": "F.", "last_name": "Chase", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-011", "ftm_eid": 29336561, "votesmart_id": 156454, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 533157, "ballotpedia": "Amanda_Chase", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2101372, "date": "2020-01-16", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1001/id/2101372", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+SB1001+hil", "text_size": 21120, "text_hash": "2a8934ae5a1662da826fe552e930e7e3"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2020-01-23", "time": "08:00", "location": "Senate Room A, Pocahontas Bldg.", "description": "Senate Committee on Education and Health Hearing"}]}}
