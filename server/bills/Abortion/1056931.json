Eliminates all the procedures and processes, including the performance of an ultrasound, required to effect a woman's informed written consent to the performance of an abortion; however, the bill does not change the requirement that a woman's informed written consent be first obtained. The bill eliminates the requirement that two other physicians certify that a third trimester abortion is necessary to prevent the woman's death or impairment of her mental or physical health as well as the need to find that the woman's health would be substantially and irremediably impaired. The bill removes language classifying facilities that perform five or more first-trimester abortions per month as hospitals for the purpose of complying with regulations establishing minimum standards for hospitals.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-10", "committee_id": 163, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Education and Health"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-10", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/10/18 18100950D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2018-01-10", "action": "Referred to Committee on Education and Health", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2018-01-18", "action": "Stricken at request of patron in Education and Health (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16176, "person_hash": "vzy4phmh", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jennifer Wexton", "first_name": "Jennifer", "middle_name": "T.", "last_name": "Wexton", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-033", "ftm_eid": 19907288, "votesmart_id": 147013, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 484877, "ballotpedia": "Jennifer_Wexton", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1684816, "date": "2018-01-10", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB709/id/1684816", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+SB709+hil", "text_size": 35305, "text_hash": "677031e6bb0217ff7e1dc50161cc97d8"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 686099, "date": "2018-01-18", "desc": "Senate: Stricken at request of patron in Education and Health (15-Y 0-N)", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB709/id/686099", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+vot+S04V0026+SB0709"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2018-01-18", "time": "08:00", "location": "Senate Room A, Pocahontas Building", "description": "Senate Committee on Education and Health Hearing"}]}}
