Requires Coverage for reproductive health services. Requires health benefit plans to cover the costs of specified health care services, drugs, devices, products, and procedures related to reproductive health, including (i) well-woman preventive visits; (ii) counseling for sexually transmitted infections; (iii) screening for certain conditions; (iv) folic acid supplements; (v) breastfeeding support, counseling, and supplies; (vi) breast cancer chemoprevention counseling; (vii) contraceptive drugs, devices, or products; (viii) voluntary sterilization; and (ix) any additional preventive services for women that must be covered without cost sharing under federal law as of January 1, 2019. The mandated coverage does not include abortion services other than when performed when the life of the mother is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, or when the pregnancy is the result of an alleged act of rape or incest. The measure provides an exemption for plans sold to religious employers. Carriers are prohibited from excluding a covered person from participating in, being denied the benefits of, or otherwise being subjected to discrimination in the coverage of or payment for reproductive health services, and a violation constitutes an unfair trade practice.
