Prohibits the practice of dismemberment abortion, which is defined in the bill as meaning to, with the purpose of causing the death of an unborn child, purposely dismember a living unborn child and extract him one piece at a time from the uterus through the use of clamps, grasping forceps, tongs, scissors, or any other instrument that, through the convergence of two rigid levers, slice, crush, or grasp a portion of the unborn child's body to cut or rip such portion of the unborn child's body. The term does not include an abortion that uses suction to dismember the body of an unborn child by sucking fetal parts into a collection container, but it does include an abortion in which a dismemberment abortion is used to cause the death of an unborn child but suction is subsequently used to extract fetal parts after the death of the unborn child. The bill provides that a person who purposely performs a dismemberment abortion is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A cause of action is also created for injunctive relief and civil damages. An exception is made when a dismemberment abortion is necessary to prevent serious health risk to the unborn child's mother.", "pending_committee_id": 150, "committee": {"committee_id": 150, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Courts of Justice"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-01-13", "committee_id": 150, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Courts of Justice"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-01-13", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/21 21102889D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-13", "action": "Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-02-05", "action": "Left in Courts of Justice", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 16090, "person_hash": "h8igditd", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Dave LaRock", "first_name": "Dave", "middle_name": "A.", "last_name": "LaRock", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-033", "ftm_eid": 16700069, "votesmart_id": 144509, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 456384, "ballotpedia": "Dave_LaRock", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2239238, "date": "2021-01-13", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2241/id/2239238", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+ful+HB2241+hil", "text_size": 11989, "text_hash": "76cbd6a0cab8d983dbae060a71a7a912"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 129860, "date": "2021-01-13", "type": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "type_id": 3, "title": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "description": "House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/21 21102889D", "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/supplement/HB2241/id/129860", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+oth+HB2241F160+PDF", "supplement_size": 168166, "supplement_hash": "c4e54c3c301a2f3bee600f6e24330b9d"}, {"supplement_id": 132516, "date": "2021-01-22", "type": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "type_id": 3, "title": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "description": "House: Impact statement from DPB (HB2241)", "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/supplement/HB2241/id/132516", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+oth+HB2241F122+PDF", "supplement_size": 94468, "supplement_hash": "1e0f104273ad81173e90550aabafa0e4"}], "calendar": []}}
