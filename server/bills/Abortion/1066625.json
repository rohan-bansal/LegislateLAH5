The bill also authorizes injunctive relief to prevent an abortion provider from performing or attempting further such abortions. Violations of this bill are deemed to be prohibited discrimination under title VI (Federally Assisted Programs) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Medical and mental health professionals must report known or suspected violations to law enforcement authorities. A woman having such an abortion may not be prosecuted or held civilly liable. Courts must make such orders as necessary to protect the anonymity of any woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted if she does not give her written consent to such disclosure. In the absence of such consent, any party, other than a public official, who brings an action must use a pseudonym.", "pending_committee_id": 2330, "committee": {"committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-19", "committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-19", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 18413, "person_hash": "i8432eqr", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Kennedy", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Kennedy", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-LA", "ftm_eid": 13010864, "votesmart_id": 35496, "opensecrets_id": "N00026823", "knowwho_pid": 240389, "ballotpedia": "John_Neely_Kennedy", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB4660", "sast_bill_id": 1036938}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13347, "subject_name": "Abortion"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13373, "subject_name": "Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"}, {"subject_id": 13210, "subject_name": "Health information and medical records"}, {"subject_id": 13211, "subject_name": "Health personnel"}, {"subject_id": 13270, "subject_name": "Right of privacy"}, {"subject_id": 13326, "subject_name": "Sex, gender, sexual orientation discrimination"}, {"subject_id": 13340, "subject_name": "Crime and law enforcement"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1695896, "date": "2018-01-23", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB2326/id/1695896", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s2326/BILLS-115s2326is.pdf", "text_size": 274447, "text_hash": "d8849551ec696d14815928620697ea34"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
