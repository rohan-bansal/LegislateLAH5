Allows a parent or legal custodian of a minor to delegate to another person by a properly executed power of attorney any powers regarding care, custody, or property of the minor for a period not exceeding one year. The bill provides that a parent or legal custodian who is a service member, as defined in the bill, may delegate such powers for a period of longer than a year while on active duty service, but specifies that such a period is not to exceed such active duty service plus 30 days. The bill also exempts from the requirement to obtain a license as a child-placing agency a private, nonprofit organization that assists parents with the process of delegating parental or legal custodial powers of their children, including assistance with identifying appropriate placements for their children, or that provides services and resources to support parents and legal guardians to whom custody has been transferred pursuant to a temporary delegation of parental or legal custodial powers. However, such private, nonprofit organizations will be subject to background checks and must develop and implement written policies for certain services and provide staff and provider training.",
