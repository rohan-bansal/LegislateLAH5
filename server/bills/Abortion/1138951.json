Establishes a process for the sheriff or administrator in charge of a local or regional correctional facility to petition a court to authorize medical or mental health treatment for a prisoner in such facility who is incapable of giving informed consent for such treatment. The process parallels the existing process for the Director of the Department of Corrections to seek authorization to provide involuntary treatment to prisoners in state correctional facilities. The bill requires the court to authorize such treatment in a facility designated by the sheriff or administrator upon finding that the prisoner is incapable, either mentally or physically, of giving informed consent; that the prisoner does not have a relevant advanced directive, guardian, or other substitute decision maker; that the proposed treatment is in the best interests of the prisoner; and that the jail has sufficient medical and nursing resources available to safely administer the treatment and respond to any adverse side effects that might arise from the treatment. The bill provides that the treatment ordered may be provided within a local or regional correctional facility if such facility is licensed to provide such treatment. If statutory procedures are followed, the service provider does not have liability based on lack of consent or lack of capacity to consent unless there is injury or death resulting from gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2019-01-05", "committee_id": 150, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Courts of
