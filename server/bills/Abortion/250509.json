(Current law prohibits such funds from being used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.) Excludes hospitals from such provisions as long as the hospital does not subgrant to a non-hospital entity that performs abortions. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit to Congress a list of grantees who perform abortions, regardless of how such abortions are funded. Makes such a grantee ineligible for family planning funds for subsequent fiscal years unless the grantee certifies that neither the grantee nor any subgrantee performs abortions that are not explicitly permitted under this Act.", "pending_committee_id": 2328, "committee": {"committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2011-01-25", "committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}], "history": [{"date": "2011-01-25", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9456, "person_hash": "63v8phh8", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "David Vitter", "first_name": "David", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Vitter", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-LA", "ftm_eid": 19890121, "votesmart_id": 4615, "opensecrets_id": "N00009659", "knowwho_pid": 158868, "ballotpedia": "David_Vitter", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9498, "person_hash": "h36jfrfy", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Tom Coburn", "first_name": "Tom", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Coburn", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OK", "ftm_eid": 8604163, "votesmart_id": 22085, "opensecrets_id": "N00005601", "knowwho_pid": 159021, "ballotpedia": "Tom_Coburn", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9495, "person_hash": "ap8jo17y", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jim DeMint", "first_name": "Jim", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "DeMint", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-SC", "ftm_eid": 19889388, "votesmart_id": 25026, "opensecrets_id": "N00002472", "knowwho_pid": 159058, "ballotpedia": "Jim_DeMint", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9452, "person_hash": "zf1jqrq4", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Michael Enzi", "first_name": "Michael", "middle_name": "B.", "last_name": "Enzi", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-WY", "ftm_eid": 6651769, "votesmart_id": 558, "opensecrets_id": "N00006249", "knowwho_pid": 165292, "ballotpedia": "Mike_Enzi", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9478, "person_hash": "zsyqtkoo", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "James Inhofe", "first_name": "James", "middle_name": "M.", "last_name": "Inhofe", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OK", "ftm_eid": 10938141, "votesmart_id": 27027, "opensecrets_id": "N00005582", "knowwho_pid": 165264, "ballotpedia": "Jim_Inhofe", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 5, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9480, "person_hash": "xrlggryx", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mike Johanns", "first_name": "Mike", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Johanns", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-NE", "ftm_eid": 0, "votesmart_id": 21309, "opensecrets_id": "N00029444", "knowwho_pid": 209671, "ballotpedia": "Mike_Johanns", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 6, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9493, "person_hash": "cabmgf99", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Roger Wicker", "first_name": "Roger", "middle_name": "F.", "last_name": "Wicker", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-MS", "ftm_eid": 17659028, "votesmart_id": 21926, "opensecrets_id": "N00003280", "knowwho_pid": 158928, "ballotpedia": "Roger_Wicker", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 7, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13347, "subject_name": "Abortion"}, {"subject_id": 14072, "subject_name": "Birth control"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13209, "subject_name": "Health facilities and institutions"}, {"subject_id": 13212, "subject_name": "Health programs administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13304, "subject_name": "Health"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 165999, "date": "2011-01-31", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB96/id/165999", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/s96/BILLS-112s96is.pdf", "text_size": 163714, "text_hash": "f9fd4f4bbc20d60e1c83f110ef3525a7"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
