Provides that, during these trainings, mandated reporters shall complete a pretest to assess baseline implicit bias levels, an implicit bias training task, and a posttest to reevaluate bias levels after training. Provides that the implicit bias curriculum for mandated reporters shall be developed within one year after the effective date of the amendatory Act and shall be created in consultation with organizations demonstrating expertise and or experience in the areas of implicit bias, youth and adolescent developmental issues, prevention of child abuse, exploitation, and neglect, culturally diverse family systems, and the child welfare system.
