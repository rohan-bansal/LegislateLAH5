This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to terminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The bill increases funding for community health centers. The Department of Health and Human Services may not collect fees or make payments under the transitional reinsurance program. The bill makes appropriations for grants to states to address substance abuse or urgent mental health needs. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, including to require individuals to pay back all excess advance payments of the premium assistance tax credit. The premium assistance tax credit and reduced cost sharing are terminated at the end of 2018. The small employer health insurance tax credit does not apply after 2018. Individuals are no longer required to maintain minimum essential health care coverage. Large employers are no longer required to provide health coverage to employees. For one year, the bill restricts the availability of federal funding for payments to certain family planning providers (e.g., Planned Parenthood Federation of America). This bill amends the Social Security Act, including to end the expansion of Medicaid under PPACA on December 31, 2018. The tax on high-cost, employer-sponsored health coverage (popularly known as the \"Cadillac tax\") does not apply after 2018. The bill revises provisions regarding health savings accounts, Archer medical savings accounts, health flexible spending arrangements, and health reimbursement arrangements, including to allow payments for over-the-counter medications. The bill eliminates various taxes and fees imposed by PPACA, including the tax on medical devices, the annual fee on health insurers, the indoor tanning services tax, and the net investment income tax.
