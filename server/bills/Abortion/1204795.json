Adds youth athletic program workers as mandated reporters. Provides that recreational or athletic program or facility personnel who are required to report child abuse must complete mandated reporter training by a provider or agency with expertise in recognizing and reporting child abuse. Enhances the criminal penalty for any person who knowingly and willfully violates certain reporting requirements for mandated reporters. Makes a violation a Class 4 felony (rather than a Class A misdemeanor for a first violation and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation), except that if the person acted as part of a plan or scheme having as its object the prevention of discovery of an abused or neglected child by lawful authorities for the purpose of protecting or insulating any person or entity from arrest or prosecution, the person commits a Class 3 felony (rather than a Class 4 felony for a first offense and a Class 3 felony for a second or subsequent offense). Enhances the criminal penalty for any other person required to report suspected child abuse or neglect who willfully fails to report such abuse or neglect by making it a Class 4 felony (rather than a Class A misdemeanor for a first violation and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation). Requires a youth athletic program to have a background check performed for each youth athletic program worker by a reputable, licensed third-party vendor.
