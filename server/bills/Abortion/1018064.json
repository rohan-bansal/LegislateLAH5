For each of FY2019-FY2029 each state that receives means-tested welfare spending by the federal government shall report annually to the Congressional Budget Office on the total amount of such spending by the state for the fiscal year. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to define means-tested welfare spending as spending for any federal program designed specifically to give assistance or benefits exclusively to low-income Americans. The refundable portion of certain tax credits shall also be means-tested welfare spending, as well as the refundable portion of the premium and out-of-pocket health care subsidies to be paid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act. The bill revises work eligibility requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act is amended to create the work preparation program for TANF families. The bill eliminates separate participation rate requirements for two-parent families. No federal funds shall be made available to carry out any means-tested housing program, but states may receive grants to fund their own housing programs. The bill prohibits funding for abortions and for health benefits that cover abortion, including certain tax credits, except where the pregnancy results from rape or incest or in certain other health cases.", "pending_committee_id": 2326, "committee": {"committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-06-05", "committee_id": 2326, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Finance"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-06-05", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11909, "person_hash": "yhq11h7j", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mike Lee", "first_name": "Mike", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Lee", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-UT", "ftm_eid": 19890610, "votesmart_id": 66395, "opensecrets_id": "N00031696", "knowwho_pid": 268656, "ballotpedia": "Mike_Lee_(Utah)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 15313, "person_hash": "kkwugc78", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Ted Cruz", "first_name": "Ted", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Cruz", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-TX", "ftm_eid": 210204, "votesmart_id": 135705, "opensecrets_id": "N00033085", "knowwho_pid": 378522, "ballotpedia": "Ted_Cruz", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 16520, "person_hash": "pw88booc", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "David Perdue", "first_name": "David", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Perdue", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-GA", "ftm_eid": 12377537, "votesmart_id": 151330, "opensecrets_id": "N00035516", "knowwho_pid": 474720, "ballotpedia": "David_Perdue", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9478, "person_hash": "zsyqtkoo", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "James Inhofe", "first_name": "James", "middle_name": "M.", "last_name": "Inhofe", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OK", "ftm_eid": 10938141, "votesmart_id": 27027, "opensecrets_id": "N00005582", "knowwho_pid": 165264, "ballotpedia": "Jim_Inhofe", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 11074, "person_hash": "68wregy0", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Tim Scott", "first_name": "Tim", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Scott", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-SC-1", "ftm_eid": 6644860, "votesmart_id": 11940, "opensecrets_id": "N00031782", "knowwho_pid": 272024, "ballotpedia": "Tim_Scott", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 5, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB2832", "sast_bill_id": 1018856}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB2996", "sast_bill_id": 1020612}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13347, "subject_name": "Abortion"}, {"subject_id": 13134, "subject_name": "Appropriations"}, {"subject_id": 13138, "subject_name": "Budget process"}, {"subject_id": 13668, "subject_name": "Child care and development"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13168, "subject_name": "Economic development"}, {"subject_id": 13176, "subject_name": "Employment and training programs"}, {"subject_id": 13179, "subject_name": "Energy assistance for the poor and aged"}, {"subject_id": 13190, "subject_name": "Food assistance and relief"}, {"subject_id": 13203, "subject_name": "Government trust funds"}, {"subject_id": 13206, "subject_name": "Health care costs and insurance"}, {"subject_id": 13207, "subject_name": "Health care coverage and access"}, {"subject_id": 13212, "subject_name": "Health programs administration and funding"}, {"subject_id": 13219, "subject_name": "Housing and community development funding"}, {"subject_id": 13224, "subject_name": "Income tax credits"}, {"subject_id": 13259, "subject_name": "Poverty and welfare assistance"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}, {"subject_id": 13383, "subject_name": "Social welfare"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1632324, "date": "2017-06-12", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1290/id/1632324", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s1290/BILLS-115s1290is.pdf", "text_size": 357809, "text_hash": "9645f91e6a49653ab5f1f9281ef4828b"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
