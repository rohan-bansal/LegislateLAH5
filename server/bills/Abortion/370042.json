Creates the Virginia Health Benefit Exchange, which will be established and operated by a new division within the State Corporation Commission. The Exchange shall facilitate the purchase and sale of qualified health plans and qualified dental plans to qualified individuals and qualified employers. The Exchange will be funded by assessments on health insurers offering plans in the Exchange. A health plan will not be required to cover any state mandated health benefit if federal law does not require it to be covered as part of the essential benefits package. The essential health benefits are items and services included in the benchmark health insurance plan, which is the largest plan in the largest product in the Commonwealth's small group market as supplemented in order to provide coverage for the items and services within the statutory essential health benefits categories. The Exchange shall ensure that no qualified health insurance plan that is sold or offered for sale through the Exchange provides coverage for abortions, except for an abortion performed (i) when the life of the mother is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, or (ii) when the pregnancy is the result of an alleged act of rape or incest. The measure shall expire if any section, clause, provision, or portion of Title I, subtitle D of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act shall be repealed or held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2012-01-11", "action": "Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/12 12100906D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-11", "action": "Senate: Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2012-01-20", "action": "Senate: Assigned C&L sub: Health Insurance", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-02-13", "action": "Senate: Committee substitute printed 12104848D-S1", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-02-13", "action": "Senate: Incorporates SB488", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-02-13", "action": "Senate: Continued to 2013 in Commerce and Labor (16-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 799, "person_hash": "445lnjcv", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Watkins", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "C.", "last_name": "Watkins", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-010", "ftm_eid": 13013696, "votesmart_id": 5201, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199392, "ballotpedia": "John_Watkins_(Virginia)", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 231, "subject_name": "Health"}, {"subject_id": 240, "subject_name": "Insurance"}, {"subject_id": 312, "subject_name": "Study Commissions, Committees, and Reports"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 539740, "date": "2012-01-11", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB496/id/539740", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+SB496+hil", "text_size": 51994, "text_hash": "97af6e79725c4c285132575eb3b88653"}, {"doc_id": 585797, "date": "2012-02-13", "type": "Comm Sub", "type_id": 2, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB496/id/585797", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+SB496S1+hil", "text_size": 75094, "text_hash": "eac54e8aeb1fad7e171c19f67ca22974"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 153776, "date": "2012-02-13", "desc": "Senate: Continued to 2013 in Commerce and Labor (16-Y 0-N)", "yea": 16, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 16, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB496/id/153776", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+vot+S02V0059+SB0496"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
