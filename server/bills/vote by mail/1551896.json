Provides for collective bargaining by public employees. The bill creates the Public Employee Relations Board, which will determine appropriate bargaining units and provide for certification and decertification elections for exclusive bargaining representatives of state employees and local government employees. The measure requires public employers and employee organizations that are exclusive bargaining representatives to meet at reasonable times to negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. The measure repeals a provision enacted in 2013 that declares that, in any procedure providing for the designation, selection, or authorization of a labor organization to represent employees, the right of an individual employee to vote by secret ballot is a fundamental right that shall be guaranteed from infringement.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2022-01-11", "committee_id": 161, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Commerce and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2022-01-11", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/12/22 22102259D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2022-01-11", "action": "Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2022-01-17", "action": "Stricken at request of Patron in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 21451, "person_hash": "9hryy1b3", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Ghazala Hashmi", "first_name": "Ghazala", "middle_name": "F.", "last_name": "Hashmi", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-010", "ftm_eid": 47299328, "votesmart_id": 186377, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 702466, "ballotpedia": "Ghazala_Hashmi", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 243, "subject_name": "Labor and Employment"}, {"subject_id": 169184, "subject_name": "Commissions Boards and Institutions Generally"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2471349, "date": "2022-01-11", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB264/id/2471349", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB264+hil", "text_size": 64874, "text_hash": "11ed98e71db7c8d07b784291dca744b7"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 1124403, "date": "2022-01-17", "desc": "Senate: Stricken at request of Patron in Commerce and Labor (15-Y 0-N)", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB264/id/1124403", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+vot+S02V0016+SB0264"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2022-01-17", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor Hearing"}]}}
