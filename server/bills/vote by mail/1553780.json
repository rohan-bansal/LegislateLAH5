The bill provides that the pilot program is in effect for elections held on and after January 1, 2023. The Commissioner is required by the bill to submit a report on or before December 1, 2027, on the outcomes of the pilot program and to include a recommendation on whether to implement the electronic return of voted military-overseas ballots on a permanent, statewide basis.
