Specifically, regarding voter registration for federal elections, the bill prohibits the use of automatic voter registration systems, requires individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote, requires individuals to provide their full Social Security number on their voter registration application, and requires courts to notify state election officials when an individual is recused from jury duty because the individual is not a U.S. citizen. Next, regarding the casting of ballots in federal elections, the bill requires individuals to provide proof of identification for absentee and in-person voting, prohibits states from mailing unrequested absentee ballots, prohibits the use of a drop box for collecting voted absentee ballots unless it is located inside of a building that serves as an office for the election official, restricts the delivery of ballots by third parties (i.e., prohibits ballot harvesting), requires that absentee ballots be received before the polls close on election day, and requires states to use Social Security numbers to verify the identification of each individual who casts a ballot. Finally, regarding the tabulation of ballots in federal elections, the bill requires states to permit poll watching by at least two campaign representatives per campaign, requires continuous counting of ballots after the closure of polling places on election day, and requires an audit of voting systems.", "pending_committee_id": 2331, "committee": {"committee_id": 2331, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Rules And Administration"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-02-25", "committee_id": 2331, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Rules And Administration"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-02-25", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 20297, "person_hash": "9aqi5rh3", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Rick Scott", "first_name": "Richard", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "Scott", "suffix": "", "nickname": "Rick", "district": "SD-FL", "ftm_eid": 422306, "votesmart_id": 124204, "opensecrets_id": "N00043290", "knowwho_pid": 289276, "ballotpedia": "Rick_Scott", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 19622, "person_hash": "0ya4l9wg", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Cindy Hyde-Smith", "first_name": "Cindy", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Hyde-Smith", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-MS", "ftm_eid": 6408036, "votesmart_id": 20784, "opensecrets_id": "N00043298", "knowwho_pid": 196212, "ballotpedia": "Cindy_Hyde-Smith", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9483, "person_hash": "sjcjzxst", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Barrasso", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Barrasso", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-WY", "ftm_eid": 10154698, "votesmart_id": 52662, "opensecrets_id": "N00006236", "knowwho_pid": 214311, "ballotpedia": "John_Barrasso", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9296, "person_hash": "ca5denhm", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Cynthia Lummis", "first_name": "Cynthia", "middle_name": "M.", "last_name": "Lummis", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-WY", "ftm_eid": 6365823, "votesmart_id": 15546, "opensecrets_id": "N00029788", "knowwho_pid": 240578, "ballotpedia": "Cynthia_Lummis", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 14888, "person_hash": "00ti0jne", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Kevin Cramer", "first_name": "Kevin", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Cramer", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-ND", "ftm_eid": 13010662, "votesmart_id": 444, "opensecrets_id": "N00004614", "knowwho_pid": 240471, "ballotpedia": "Kevin_Cramer", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 5, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "HB322", "sast_bill_id": 1408699}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB873", "sast_bill_id": 1439854}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB1130", "sast_bill_id": 1500524}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13356, "subject_name": "Government operations and politics"}, {"subject_id": 13305, "subject_name": "Citizenship and naturalization"}, {"subject_id": 13432, "subject_name": "Congressional elections"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13231, "subject_name": "Intergovernmental relations"}, {"subject_id": 13606, "subject_name": "Judicial procedure and administration"}, {"subject_id": 13355, "subject_name": "Postal service"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2345790, "date": "2021-03-23", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB459/id/2345790", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/s459/BILLS-117s459is.pdf", "text_size": 281868, "text_hash": "05fd3ca6aae8376bd7c265753b14ee16"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
