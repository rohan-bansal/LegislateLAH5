Requirements for exceptions to such prohibitions are prescribed. Each of the states whose territory contains all or part of an Indian reservation shall designate, for each Indian tribe of each Indian reservation, an officer within that state responsible for compliance with this Act. Any state whose territory contains all or part of an Indian reservation shall provide one or more polling places for each Indian tribe satisfying certain obligations. In states that provide for early voting a state or local election official shall provide upon request at least one early voting location on an Indian reservation. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is amended to require the Office of Personnel Management to assign an appropriate number of observers whenever the Attorney General receives a written complaint from an Indian tribe that efforts to deny or abridge the right to vote under the color of law on account of race or color, or in contravention of specified guarantees, are likely to occur.", "pending_committee_id": 2330, "committee": {"committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2015-07-30", "committee_id": 2330, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Judiciary"}], "history": [{"date": "2015-07-30", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9471, "person_hash": "61xtznm6", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jon Tester", "first_name": "Jon", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Tester", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-MT", "ftm_eid": 7974707, "votesmart_id": 20928, "opensecrets_id": "N00027605", "knowwho_pid": 196276, "ballotpedia": "Jon_Tester", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9476, "person_hash": "3us9m996", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Al Franken", "first_name": "Al", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Franken", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-MN", "ftm_eid": 1646379, "votesmart_id": 108924, "opensecrets_id": "N00029016", "knowwho_pid": 266864, "ballotpedia": "Al_Franken", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 15318, "person_hash": "r7inzg5c", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Heidi Heitkamp", "first_name": "Heidi", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Heitkamp", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-ND", "ftm_eid": 2111551, "votesmart_id": 41716, "opensecrets_id": "N00033782", "knowwho_pid": 391869, "ballotpedia": "Heidi_Heitkamp", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9472, "person_hash": "4c2m8lz3", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Tom Udall", "first_name": "Tom", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Udall", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-NM", "ftm_eid": 1864753, "votesmart_id": 22658, "opensecrets_id": "N00006561", "knowwho_pid": 158967, "ballotpedia": "Tom_Udall", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9061, "person_hash": "yqm2ur4v", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mazie Hirono", "first_name": "Mazie", "middle_name": "K.", "last_name": "Hirono", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-HI-2", "ftm_eid": 6401094, "votesmart_id": 1677, "opensecrets_id": "N00028139", "knowwho_pid": 248294, "ballotpedia": "Mazie_Hirono", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 5, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13780, "subject_name": "Alaska Natives and Hawaiians"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13378, "subject_name": "Federal-Indian relations"}, {"subject_id": 22689, "subject_name": "Foreign language and bilingual programs"}, {"subject_id": 13667, "subject_name": "General Native American affairs matters"}, {"subject_id": 13379, "subject_name": "Indian lands and resources rights"}, {"subject_id": 13325, "subject_name": "Racial and ethnic relations"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}, {"subject_id": 13434, "subject_name": "Voting rights"}, {"subject_id": 13356, "subject_name": "Government operations and politics"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1257767, "date": "2015-08-06", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB1912/id/1257767", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s1912/BILLS-114s1912is.pdf", "text_size": 263714, "text_hash": "a57da23c83671da5bce1acea7e77fc3a"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
