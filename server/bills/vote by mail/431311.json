Requires an individual who does not present such an ID to be permitted to cast a provisional ballot in such an election. Requires such individual, however, to present the required ID within 48 hours after casting the provisional ballot, or the appropriate state or local election official may not determine the individual's eligibility to vote. Requires individuals who vote other than in person in a federal election (for example, by mail) to submit a copy of such a photo ID with a ballot, or the appropriate official may not accept the ballot. Exempts from this requirement the absentee ballot of any eligible overseas military voter absent from the United States by reason of active duty or service. Requires states to establish a program to provide photo IDs in accordance with this Act to individuals who desire to vote but do not otherwise possess a government-issued photo ID. Prescribes requirements for any state fee for providing such a photo ID. Requires the Election Assistance Commission to make payments to states to cover the costs incurred in providing photo IDs to individuals unable to afford the fee.", "pending_committee_id": 2596, "committee": {"committee_id": 2596, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Elections"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2012-06-19", "committee_id": 2307, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Administration"}, {"date": "2012-06-21", "committee_id": 2596, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Elections"}], "history": [{"date": "2012-06-19", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on House Administration.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2012-06-21", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Elections.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11078, "person_hash": "km57c96q", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Joe Walsh", "first_name": "Joe", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Walsh", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-IL-8", "ftm_eid": 6624786, "votesmart_id": 116545, "opensecrets_id": "N00004723", "knowwho_pid": 284437, "ballotpedia": "Joe_Walsh_(Illinois)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB6408", "sast_bill_id": 433446}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13432, "subject_name": "Congressional elections"}, {"subject_id": 13430, "subject_name": "Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13484, "subject_name": "Military personnel and dependents"}, {"subject_id": 13664, "subject_name": "Photography and imaging"}, {"subject_id": 13259, "subject_name": "Poverty and welfare assistance"}, {"subject_id": 13648, "subject_name": "User charges and fees"}, {"subject_id": 13356, "subject_name": "Government operations and politics"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 657092, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB5971/id/657092", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/hr5971/BILLS-112hr5971ih.pdf", "text_size": 259118, "text_hash": "196cdb269065b9d321acdea94e23e9a8"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
