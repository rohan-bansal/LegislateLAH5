Requires that, unless otherwise stated, the opening of return absentee ballot envelopes and signature validation commence the day immediately after ballots are transmitted to voters through election day. Provides that the counting of absentee ballots may begin no earlier than the fifteenth day prior to an election and establishes stages of absentee ballot counting. Prohibits persons present during the counting of absentee ballots from disclosing the results. Allows, rather than requires, observation of ballot handling by an official. Allows defective ballots to be replaced with new ballots by counting center employees without the presence of at least two official observers.
