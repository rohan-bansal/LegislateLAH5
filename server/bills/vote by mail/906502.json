Allows any registered voter to vote early in any election in which he is qualified to vote without providing a reason or making prior application for an absentee ballot.

The bill further requires early voting to be available during regular business hours each weekday during the applicable period, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on each Saturday during the applicable period, and from 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on each Sunday during the applicable period.
