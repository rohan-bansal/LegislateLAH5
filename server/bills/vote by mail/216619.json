Amends the Revised Statutes to prohibit false statements, including those about public endorsements, intended to mislead voters in federal elections. Creates a private right of action for preventive relief against such false statements. Authorizes the Attorney General to communicate to the public corrections to materially false information if state or local election officials have not taken prompt and adequate steps to do so. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) increase the penalty for voter intimidation; and (2) prohibit voter caging and challenges based on certain evidence. Defines \"voter caging document\" as: (1) a nonforwardable document that is returned to the sender or a third party as undelivered or undeliverable despite an attempt to deliver it to the address of a registered voter or applicant; or (2) any document with instructions to an addressee that the document be returned to a sender or third party but is not so returned, despite an attempt to deliver it to the address of a registered voter, unless at least two federal election cycles have passed since the date of the attempted delivery. States that the right of a U.S. citizen to vote in any election for federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense, unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election.  Treats election day in the same manner as a legal public holiday for purposes of federal employment.  Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress and the President on the impact of such treatment on voter participation. Expresses the sense of Congress that private employers in the United States should give their employees a day off on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November 2012 and each even-numbered year thereafter to enable them to cast votes in the elections held on that day.", "pending_committee_id": 2625, "committee": {"committee_id": 2625, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service, and Labor Policy"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2011-01-05", "committee_id": 2309, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Judiciary"}, {"date": "2011-01-24", "committee_id": 2346, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on the Constitution"}, {"date": "2011-02-08", "committee_id": 2625, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service, and Labor Policy"}], "history": [{"date": "2011-01-05", "action": "Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
