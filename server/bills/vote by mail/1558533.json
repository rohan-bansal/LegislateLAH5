Requires a registered voter to provide a reason for being absent or unable to vote at his polling place on election day in order to receive an absentee ballot to vote by mail. The bill requires a voter voting absentee by mail to open his ballot in the presence of a notary who must sign the ballot return envelope. The bill requires that the general registrar match the signature of the voter on an absentee return envelope to a signature that the general registrar has on file before processing the ballot. If the signature doesn't match, the absentee ballot is to be treated as a provisional vote subject to approval by the electoral board. The bill also repeals the permanent absentee voter list and limits the special annual application to those voters with an illness or disability.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2022-01-12", "committee_id": 167, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}], "history": [{"date": "2022-01-12", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/12/22 22101614D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2022-01-12", "action": "Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2022-01-25", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Privileges and Elections (9-Y 5-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17747, "person_hash": "20byu1wu", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Amanda Chase", "first_name": "Amanda", "middle_name": "F.", "last_name": "Chase", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-011", "ftm_eid": 29336561, "votesmart_id": 156454, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 533157, "ballotpedia": "Amanda_Chase", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 215, "subject_name": "Elections"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2477943, "date": "2022-01-12", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB552/id/2477943", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB552+hil", "text_size": 62490, "text_hash": "eee586d99000300c194a06acadb80001"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 1127767, "date": "2022-01-25", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Privileges and Elections (9-Y 5-N)", "yea": 9, "nay": 5, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB552/id/1127767", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+vot+S08V0044+SB0552"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 226826, "date": "2022-01-24", "type": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "type_id": 3, "title": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "description": "Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/12/22 22101614D", "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/supplement/SB552/id/226826", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+oth+SB552F122+PDF", "supplement_size": 70136, "supplement_hash": "44eb3ce65b3d57f633236ec41add8806"}], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2022-01-18", "time": "00:00", "location": "SR 3/ Public register speak GA website", "description": "Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2022-01-25", "time": "00:00", "location": "", "description": "Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections Hearing"}]}}
