Requires the State Board of Elections to design an alternative signature verification method for the verification of petition signatures for statewide advisory referenda (rather than designing a standard and scientific random sampling method for the verification of petition signatures for statewide advisory referenda).

Entitles registered proponents and opponents of a proposed amendment to the Legislative Article of the Illinois Constitution to observe the conduct of the sample signature verification. Entitles each political party, civic organization, and registered proponents and opponents of a proposed amendment to the Legislative Article of the Illinois Constitution or statewide advisory public question to participate in any proceedings related to the sample signature verification.
