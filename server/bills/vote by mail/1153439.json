During the early voting period, any person who is qualified to register to vote shall be permitted to register to vote and cast a ballot in person in the office of the general registrar or at another location in the county or city approved by the electoral board. The bill also permits such persons to do so on the day of the election. The bill removes the current provisions for voting absentee in person but retains those provisions for voting an absentee ballot by mail, including the application requirement and the list of statutory reasons that allow a registered voter to vote absentee by mail.", "pending_committee_id": 156, "committee": {"committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-01-15", "committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}, {"date": "2019-01-21", "committee_id": 3879, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections: Subcommittee #1"}, {"date": "2019-02-05", "committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-01-15", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 19104144D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-01-15", "action": "Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2019-01-21", "action": "Assigned P & E sub: Subcommittee #1", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-01-22", "action": "Subcommittee recommends striking from docket (6-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-02-05", "action": "Left in Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17709, "person_hash": "bzux6pi9", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Lamont Bagby", "first_name": "Lamont", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Bagby", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-074", "ftm_eid": 29214011, "votesmart_id": 156441, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 533380, "ballotpedia": "Lamont_Bagby", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1850875, "date": "2019-01-15", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2716/id/1850875", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2716+hil", "text_size": 31851, "text_hash": "93f3fb916e24d667ffcca3b5fe5c3d2d"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 784210, "date": "2019-01-22", "desc": "House: Subcommittee recommends striking from docket (6-Y 0-N)", "yea": 6, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 6, "passed": 1, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB2716/id/784210", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+vot+H1801V0007+HB2716"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2019-01-22", "time": "00:00", "location": "House Committee Room Update", "description": "House Privileges and Elections - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
