The main substantive changes are as follows: \u2022 A Preamble was added; \u2022 Territorial limits will be established by a recorded map instead of as described as \u201c1/2 mile in every direction from the center of the Public Square\u201d; \u2022 The Annexation procedures were removed from the Charter (other than requiring contiguity and at least a majority of property owners in favor of being annexed) and will be detailed by ordinance; \u2022 Makes it clear that the Mayor is part of the Town Council; \u2022 For purposes of qualifications to be a Council member or Mayor, the Charter defines \u201cbone fide resident\u201d; \u2022 The Election procedures now follow Title 15 Municipal Elections; \u2022 The Charter clarifies how vacancies on Council occur and how these vacancies may be filled including by special election instead of appointment of a majority of Council; \u2022 The Alderman section is amended to track the recently amended Dewey Beach charter (Georgetown does not currently have an alderman). \u2022 An ethical code has been adopted by the Town and the Charter references its principles and a requirement to take an ethical oath; \u2022 The Town Manager has authority to manage the water, sewer and streets; \u2022 Annual property taxes are limited to 10% of gross assessed value; \u2022 Bond issuance not by referendum of up to 5 million dollars if from federal or state issuers at zero interest with 100% forgiveness upon successful completion of the project. Additionally, the provision relating to disqualification of a council member from office has been revised to read: \u201cIs convicted of any felony or crime involving moral turpitude, or any crime of dishonesty, or any crime involving fraud, bribery, or embezzlement\u201d.
