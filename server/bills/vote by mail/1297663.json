Prohibits an electric utility from terminating the residential service of a customer for nonpayment for metered services when the electric utility believes that the customer is receiving or has received electric utility services for which the customer was not properly billed as the result of tampering with the electric utility's meter until the electric utility has (i) retrieved the meter from the customer's premises, which may be done without providing prior notice to the customer; (ii) immediately replaced it with a new meter; and (iii) determined whether the meter has been tampered with. The measure requires that if the electric utility determines that the meter has been tampered with and seeks payment for services not properly billed, the electric utility must provide the customer with an invoice with a reasonable and final estimate of the amount owed by the customer as a result of the meter's failure. The electric utility is required to provide the customer one full billing period to pay the amount billed in such invoice. The measure authorizes a customer to submit a complaint to the State Corporation Commission and to file a formal proceeding after the informal complaint process has been exhausted. The measure includes specific conditions for which these requirements do not apply, including when the condition of a customer's wiring, equipment, or appliances is either unsafe or unsuitable for receiving the utility service or when the customer's use of the utility service or equipment interferes with or may be detrimental to the utility's facilities or to the provision of utility service by the utility to any other customer.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2020-01-07", "committee_id": 4178, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Labor and
