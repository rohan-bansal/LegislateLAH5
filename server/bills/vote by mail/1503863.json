First, the bill establishes Election Security Enhancement Units within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. These units must provide state and local election officials with access to risk management, resiliency, and technical support services provided by election administration and cybersecurity experts. Next, the bill requires a federal entity to promptly share with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) any information it receives about a security threat to federal elections. DHS must, within 96 hours, review the information and determine whether a security incident occurred. If DHS determines that a security incident occurred, then DHS must notify state and local officials about the incident, with exceptions. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) must make a grant to each eligible state to administer federal elections. In order to receive such a grant, a state must submit to the EAC certain certifications, including that the state complies with voter registration list maintenance requirements and requires voters to present valid identification. The bill also establishes within the legislative branch the Bipartisan Election Advisory Commission. The commission must study the effects of COVID-19 on the administration and security of elections and the extent of security shortfalls during the 2020 general elections. Further, the commission must report to Congress on recommendations for improving the administration of elections and enhancing the security of elections.", "pending_committee_id": 2307, "committee": {"committee_id": 2307, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Administration"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-04-26", "committee_id": 2307, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Administration"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-04-26", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-04-26", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on House Administration.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9192, "person_hash": "77p1skl0", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Michael McCaul", "first_name": "Michael", "middle_name": "T.", "last_name": "McCaul", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-TX-10", "ftm_eid": 15456789, "votesmart_id": 49210, "opensecrets_id": "N00026460", "knowwho_pid": 226551, "ballotpedia": "Michael_McCaul", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13356, "subject_name": "Government operations and politics"}, {"subject_id": 13127, "subject_name": "Advisory bodies"}, {"subject_id": 20565, "subject_name": "Computer security and identity theft"}, {"subject_id": 13466, "subject_name": "Congressional operations and organization"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13157, "subject_name": "Department of Homeland Security"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13184, "subject_name": "Executive agency funding and structure"}, {"subject_id": 13309, "subject_name": "Fraud offenses and financial crimes"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13500, "subject_name": "Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"}, {"subject_id": 13231, "subject_name": "Intergovernmental relations"}, {"subject_id": 13355, "subject_name": "Postal service"}, {"subject_id": 13868, "subject_name": "Rule of law and government transparency"}, {"subject_id": 13463, "subject_name": "Sovereignty, recognition, national governance and status"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2417855, "date": "2021-06-16", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB2844/id/2417855", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2844/BILLS-117hr2844ih.pdf", "text_size": 281931, "text_hash": "c114bf8ed713e188831d5f636d211de9"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
