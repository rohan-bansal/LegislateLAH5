Requires the circuit court clerk to seal provisional ballots and election material related to provisional ballots during the time allowed to file a verified petition or cross-petition for a recount of votes or to contest an election. Requires that election material related to provisional ballots (excluding the provisional ballots themselves) be made available for copying and inspection under the access to public records law in the same manner as other election material.  Establishes the use of vote centers as an option for all counties. Requires the county election board (board) to adopt an order designating a county a vote center county, adopt a plan to administer the vote centers, and file the order and the plan with the election division. Requires the board to accept and consider public comment before adopting an order designating the county as a vote center county. Provides that designation of a county as a vote center county remains in effect until the board rescinds the order designating the county as a vote center county and files a copy of the rescission with the election division.  Requires that a county's vote center plan must incorporate certain elements.   Provides that an electronic poll list must be programmed so that access to the list requires the coordinated action of two precinct election officials who are not members of the same political party. Allows an electronic poll list used at a vote center to include an electronic image of the voter's signature, if available. Authorizes a precinct election board administering an election at a vote center to report the vote totals by precinct on election night. Redesignates automatically as a vote center county a county previously designated a vote center pilot county.

Allows a county to seek reimbursement from the election division for expenses incurred in complying with provisions concerning the establishment of at least one satellite office in a vote center pilot county.
