or remedy the violation; make technical correction to internal references contained in Section 9; further amend Section 11 to allow notification, relative to the lienholder notification system that provides notification of final orders, to be satisfied with the provision of an electronic link to the required elements, and require the notice to be put on a website either fully or in summary form as set out in the bill, and clarify that a local government may record a lien sooner than the 45 day period allowed in the section, and require that if the lien is satisfied prior to the expiration of the 45 day period, that the local government is to release the lien within 15 days of the satisfaction; further amend Section 13 to create the section as a new section of KRS Chapter 65, rather than
