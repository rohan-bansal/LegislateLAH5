The bill limits the total number of audits anyone outside contract can be assigned and requires all contracts with such contract auditors to assure that they will not employ or compensate senior officials from the Department involved with their work for two years after such officials leave state employment. The bill amends the administrative appeal process regarding the assessment of unremitted abandoned or unclaimed property to provide that the determination of the independent reviewer shall be binding on the Secretary of Finance unless properly appealed to the Delaware Court of Chancery. The bill amends the statutory provision regarding the period of limitations to assess additional unclaimed property liability in connection with a filed annual unclaimed property report to provide that in the case of a filed report the State Escheator must make a specific finding of fraud before the State is entitled to an unlimited period of limitations with respect to assessment.
