Authorizes localities to impose a local fuels tax, not to exceed five cents per gallon of fuel. The tax would be paid by the distributor at the point of sale to a retail distributor in the same manner as regional fuel taxes. The Commonwealth would make an annual payment to localities for the difference between revenues that were collected from the tangible personal property tax on vehicles, including personal property tax relief, and the amount of revenues collected by a five-cents-per-gallon fuels tax. The bill also repeals the personal property tax relief program. The bill has a delayed effective date of January 1, 2019, and is contingent on passage of a constitutional amendment making motor vehicles used for nonbusiness purposes exempt from taxation.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2016-01-06", "committee_id": 164, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Finance and Appropriations"}], "history": [{"date": "2016-01-06", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/16 16100872D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2016-01-06", "action": "Referred to Committee on Finance", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2016-02-02", "action": "Passed by indefinitely in Finance (14-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 784, "person_hash": "d2x6eti0", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 46, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "John Petersen", "first_name": "John", "middle_name": "Chapman", "last_name": "Petersen", "suffix": "", "nickname": "Chap", "district": "SD-034", "ftm_eid": 5743839, "votesmart_id": 50842, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 209953, "ballotpedia": "John_Chapman_%22Chap%22_Petersen", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1287167, "date": "2016-01-06", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB244/id/1287167", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+SB244+hil", "text_size": 69573, "text_hash": "b064aa43f161ec7b1f934f72c5b8ff48"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 489792, "date": "2016-02-02", "desc": "Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Finance (14-Y 0-N)", "yea": 14, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB244/id/489792", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+vot+S05V0030+SB0244"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2016-02-02", "time": "09:00", "location": "Senate Room B", "description": "Senate Committee on Finance Hearing"}]}}
