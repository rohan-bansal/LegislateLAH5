compliance with disability provisions; amend KRS 67A.492 to provide a surviving minor child or children annuity in addition to the retirement benefits for surviving spouses and, based on factors including whether the surviving spouse is eligible for benefits and the number of minor children, set the benefits at between 50% and 75% of a member's final annuity, final rate of pay, or service retirement, whichever is greater, and allow benefit to extend to adult children between 18 and 23 enrolled in full-time educational activities; amend KRS 67A.530 to provide that retired fund members
