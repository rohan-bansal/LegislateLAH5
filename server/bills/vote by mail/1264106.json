The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall consider alternative forms of proof to determine the eligibility of an individual or household for assistance. FEMA shall create and distribute a declarative form statement that applicants for assistance can use to self-certify eligibility for assistance and make the statement available in specified languages at all active Disaster Recovery Centers and on its website and social media. FEMA may provide certain financial assistance for repairs to ensure that residences are habitable during longer term recovery and for permanent housing construction upon determining that such assistance is a cost effective alternative to other housing solutions. FEMA shall conduct an analysis comparing the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of assistance provided under the Disaster Housing Assistance Program, including any case management services provided, with other temporary housing options provided by it.", "pending_committee_id": 2329, "committee": {"committee_id": 2329, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2019-05-22", "committee_id": 2315, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Transportation And Infrastructure"}, {"date": "2019-05-23", "committee_id": 4010, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"}, {"date": "2020-11-18", "committee_id": 2329, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}], "history": [{"date": "2019-05-22", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2019-05-22", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2019-05-23", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2020-02-26", "action": "Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Discharged.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-02-26", "action": "Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2020-02-26", "action": "Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2020-11-16", "action": "Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
