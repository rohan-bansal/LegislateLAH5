Specifically, the bill requires a state that changes an individual's polling place to notify the individual at least seven days before the federal election or the first day of an early voting period, whichever occurs first. However, if the change is made fewer than seven days before the federal election and the individual appears at the previously assigned polling place, the state must make every reasonable effort to enable the individual to vote. Further, the bill specifies the methods of notification. In addition, states must place signs at locations that no longer serve as a polling place.", "pending_committee_id": 2307, "committee": {"committee_id": 2307, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Administration"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-02-01", "committee_id": 2307, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Administration"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-02-01", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-02-01", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on House Administration.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 18293, "person_hash": "vidnqcls", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Anthony Brown", "first_name": "Anthony", "middle_name": "G.", "last_name": "Brown", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-MD-4", "ftm_eid": 5017996, "votesmart_id": 19344, "opensecrets_id": "N00036999", "knowwho_pid": 195317, "ballotpedia": "Anthony_Brown_(Maryland)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB1", "sast_bill_id": 1393390}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB1278", "sast_bill_id": 1464472}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB954", "sast_bill_id": 1487993}, {"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "HB2358", "sast_bill_id": 1491604}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13356, "subject_name": "Government operations and politics"}, {"subject_id": 13432, "subject_name": "Congressional elections"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2303536, "date": "2021-02-22", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB641/id/2303536", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr641/BILLS-117hr641ih.pdf", "text_size": 270064, "text_hash": "f77f533e87b92f904ed5316ed246c4ec"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
