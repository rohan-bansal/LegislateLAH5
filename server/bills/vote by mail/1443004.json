Allows meetings of property owners' associations, boards of directors, unit owners' associations, executive boards, and committees to be held entirely or partially by electronic means, provided that the board of directors or executive board, as applicable, has adopted guidelines for the use of electronic means for such meetings. The bill requires that such guidelines ensure that persons accessing such meetings are authorized to do so and that persons entitled to participate in such meetings have an opportunity to do so. The bill grants authority for determining whether any such meeting may be held entirely or partially by electronic means to the board of directors or executive board, as applicable. Under current law, if a meeting of a board of directors or executive board is conducted by telephone conference or video conference, at least two members of the board of directors or executive board, as applicable, are required to be physically present at the meeting place included in the meeting notice. The bill amends the definition of \"electronic means\" to provide that a meeting conducted by electronic means includes a meeting conducted via teleconference, videoconference, Internet exchange, or other electronic methods. The bill allows members of property owners' associations or unit owners' associations to vote at meetings of such associations by absentee ballot, and allows such members to vote in person, by proxy, or by absentee ballot by electronic means, provided that the board of directors or executive board, as applicable, has adopted guidelines for such voting. Finally, the bill provides that if a vote, consent, or approval required to be obtained by secret ballot is accomplished through electronic means, the electronic means shall protect the identity of the voter, and provides that if the electronic means cannot protect the identity of the voter, another means of voting shall be used.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2021-01-06", "committee_id": 153, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "General Laws"}, {"date": "2021-01-20", "committee_id": 165, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "General Laws and Technology"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-01-06", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/21 21102459D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-06", "action": "Referred to Committee on General Laws", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-01-14", "action": "Reported from General Laws (22-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-01-15", "action": "Read first time", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-18", "action": "Read second time and engrossed", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-01-18", "action": "Engrossment reconsidered by House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-18", "action": "Engrossed by House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-01-19", "action": "Read third time and passed House BLOCK VOTE (98-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-19", "action": "VOTE: Block Vote Passage (98-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-20", "action": "Constitutional reading dispensed", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-20", "action": "Referred to Committee on General Laws and Technology", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-02-05", "action": "Continued to 2021 Sp.
