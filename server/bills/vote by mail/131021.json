Provides that such an ordinance to change the structure of county government may be adopted only during an odd-numbered year or before July 1 of an even-numbered year. Specifies that an ordinance providing for a single elected county executive officer must be approved by: (1) a unanimous vote of all the elected members of the county executive, in the case of a county executive with not more than three members; or (2) a vote of at least two-thirds of all the elected members of the county executive, in the case of a county executive with more than three members. Provides that in a county with a single county chief executive officer: (1) the initial county chief executive officer is elected in the second general election after the ordinance to change the structure of county government is approved; (2) the board of county commissioners is abolished; and (3) the membership of the county council continues under existing law. Places city offices on the primary and general election ballots before (rather than after) township offices. Provides that an employee of a political subdivision is considered to have resigned from employment with the political subdivision if the employee assumes the elected executive office of the political subdivision or becomes an elected member of the political subdivision's legislative or fiscal body. Specifies that the restriction applies to an employee of a political subdivision who assumes an elected office after June 30, 2010, but provides that the restriction does not apply to an employee of a political subdivision who holds elective office on June 30, 2010, as long as the individual continues to hold or be reelected to that office. Provides that the restriction does not prohibit an employee of a political subdivision from holding an elected office of a political subdivision other than the political subdivision that employs the government employee. Prohibits a relative of an officer or employee of a political subdivision from being employed by the political subdivision in a position that would put the relative in a direct supervisory or subordinate relationship with the officer or employee. Specifies that an employee of a political subdivision is not required by these provisions to be terminated or reassigned from any position held by that individual before July 1, 2010, but provides that this grandfathering provision expires January 1, 2015.  Provides that a political subdivision may not enter into or renew certain contracts. Provides for the adjustment of maximum property tax levies after the consolidation of fire departments in Marion County. Provides that the property tax levy limits do not apply to property taxes imposed by the consolidated city to pay indebtedness assumed or paid under a consolidation of fire departments in Marion County.    Specifies that not more than four years after the consolidation of a fire department in Marion County, the consolidated city may levy a tax above the tax rate set for the consolidated fire department in the township as necessary to phase out that township's borrowing for fire and emergency services and any other emergency or temporary loans by the township for fire and emergency services.

Provides that a building authority in Marion County must submit its operating and maintenance budget and tax levy to the city-county council for approval. Establishes the use of vote centers as an option for all counties. Requires the county election board (board) to adopt an order designating a county a vote center county, adopt a plan to administer the vote centers, and file the order and the plan with the election division. Requires the board to accept and consider public comment before adopting an order designating the county as a vote center county. Provides that designation of a county as a vote center county remains in effect until the board rescinds the order designating the county as a vote center county and files a copy of the rescission with the election division. Provides that an electronic poll list must be programmed so that access to the list requires the coordinated action of two precinct election officials who are not members of the same political party. Allows an electronic poll list used at a vote center to include an electronic image of the voter's signature, if available. Authorizes a precinct election board administering an election at a vote center to report the vote totals by precinct on election night. Redesignates automatically as a vote center county a county previously designated a vote center pilot county. Provides that school board members selected by election must be elected at general elections beginning in 2010.
