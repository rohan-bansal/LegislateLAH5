Requires certain actions to be taken to process absentee ballots returned before the day of the election, including opening sealed ballot envelopes and inserting the ballot into a ballot container or counting machine. The bill requires the establishment of a central absentee voter precinct in each locality; currently, establishment is optional. On the day of the election, officers of election are required to begin processing absentee ballots in the central absentee voter precincts prior to the close of the polls but that no ballot vote counts are permitted to be transmitted outside of the central absentee voter precinct before the close of the polls; a violation of such prohibition is a Class 1 misdemeanor. When reporting election results to the Department of Elections, the general registrars are required to report absentee ballots cast early in person separately from all other absentee ballots.
