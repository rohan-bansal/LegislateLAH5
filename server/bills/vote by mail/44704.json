Requires that ballots be prepared and available for absentee voting not later than 45 days before any election rather than 45 days before the November election and 30 days before other elections. The bill also requires preparation of ballots 45 days in advance of special elections for federal office and allows, if necessary, preparation as soon after that deadline as possible for other special elections. Various deadlines for nominations and filings are adjusted in response to the ballot preparation change.  The bill provides that voters who are entitled to vote absentee due to active duty military service, membership in the merchant marines, or temporary residence outside of the country, or the spouse or dependent residing with such a voter, may use a write-in absentee ballot to vote in state and local elections, as well as federal elections. The write-in absentee ballot may also serve as an absentee ballot application and voter registration application for state and local elections, as well as federal elections. Such voters may apply for ballots for multiple elections for a period of one year or through the end of the federal election cycle in which the voter submits his registration, whichever is longer. Current law allows multiple ballots for a period covering two federal elections. The bill also adds a requirement that the electoral board send such military and overseas voters an available printed absentee ballot within three business days. The bill also allows the counting of absentee ballots received from such voters after the close of the polls and two business days before the State Board of Elections meets to ascertain the results and allows adjusting the final returns to include such ballots.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2010-01-04", "action": "Senate: Prefiled and
