The bill allows the general registrar of any county or city to establish additional drop-off locations within the county or city as he deems necessary. The Department of Elections is required to set standards related to the establishment and operation of drop-off locations, including security requirements. The bill also requires general registrars to take certain actions to preprocess absentee ballots returned before election day and to notify an absentee voter of any errors or issues with the completion or return of his absentee ballot that would render the ballot void. The general registrars are required to enter into the voter's record in the registration system that the voter's absentee ballot has an issue requiring correction and to notify the voter in writing or by email of the error or failure, in addition to providing information on how to correct the issue. The absentee voter then has until noon on the third day following the election to make necessary corrections so that his ballot may be counted.
