Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should seek international agreements to protect Internet freedom; and (2) some U.S. businesses, in assisting foreign governments to restrict online access to U.S.-supported websites and government reports and to identify individual Internet users, are working contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require assessments of electronic information freedom in each foreign country. Establishes in the Department of State the Office of Global Internet Freedom (OGIF). Directs the Secretary of State to annually designate Internet-restricting countries. Prohibits, subject to waiver, U.S. businesses that provide to the public a commercial Internet search engine, communications services, or hosting services from locating, in such countries, any personally identifiable information used to establish or maintain an Internet services account.  Requires U.S. businesses that collect or obtain personally identifiable information through the Internet to notify the OGIF and the Attorney General (DOJ) before responding to a disclosure request from an Internet-restricting country. Authorizes the Attorney General to prohibit a business from complying with the request, except for legitimate foreign law enforcement purposes.  Requires U.S. businesses to report to the OGIF certain Internet censorship information involving Internet-restricting countries. Prohibits U.S. businesses that maintain Internet content hosting services from jamming U.S.-supported websites or U.S.-supported content in Internet-restricting countries. Authorizes the President to waive provisions of this Act: (1) to further the purposes of this Act, (2) if a country ceases restrictive activity, or (3) if it is in the national interest of the United States.", "pending_committee_id": 2556, "committee": {"committee_id": 2556, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2011-04-06", "committee_id": 2305, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Foreign Affairs"}, {"date": "2011-05-13", "committee_id": 2556, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights"}], "history": [{"date": "2011-04-06", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-04-06", "action": "Referred to House Foreign Affairs", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-04-06", "action": "Referred to House Energy and Commerce", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-04-06", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-05-13", "action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9237, "person_hash": "td566tn1", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Christopher Smith", "first_name": "Christopher", "middle_name": "H.", "last_name": "Smith", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-NJ-4", "ftm_eid": 17658186, "votesmart_id": 26952, "opensecrets_id": "N00009816", "knowwho_pid": 158955, "ballotpedia": "Chris_Smith_(New_Jersey)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9218, "person_hash": "q92eyxo7", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Thaddeus McCotter", "first_name": "Thaddeus", "middle_name": "G.", "last_name": "McCotter", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-MI-11", "ftm_eid": 2000113, "votesmart_id": 19847, "opensecrets_id": "N00013808", "knowwho_pid": 195609, "ballotpedia": "Thaddeus_McCotter", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 8989, "person_hash": "qrk1gvtk", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Brad Sherman", "first_name": "Brad", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Sherman", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-CA-30", "ftm_eid": 369166, "votesmart_id": 142, "opensecrets_id": "N00006897", "knowwho_pid": 158741, "ballotpedia": "Brad_Sherman", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 3, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9338, "person_hash": "hgphkfrm", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 52, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Frank Wolf", "first_name": "Frank", "middle_name": "R.", "last_name": "Wolf", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-VA-10", "ftm_eid": 17658729, "votesmart_id": 27120, "opensecrets_id": "N00002073", "knowwho_pid": 159113, "ballotpedia": "Frank_Wolf", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 4, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13137, "subject_name": "Broadcasting, cable, digital technologies"}, {"subject_id": 13768, "subject_name": "Business ethics"}, {"subject_id": 13161, "subject_name": "Department of State"}, {"subject_id": 13184, "subject_name": "Executive agency funding and structure"}, {"subject_id": 13365, "subject_name": "Foreign and international corporations"}, {"subject_id": 13200, "subject_name": "Government information and archives"}, {"subject_id": 13402, "subject_name": "Human rights"}, {"subject_id": 13424, "subject_name": "International law and treaties"}, {"subject_id": 13233, "subject_name": "Internet and video services"}, {"subject_id": 13270, "subject_name": "Right of privacy"}, {"subject_id": 13289, "subject_name": "Telephone and wireless communication"}, {"subject_id": 20565, "subject_name": "Computer security and identity theft"}, {"subject_id": 13422, "subject_name": "International affairs"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 262806, "date": "2011-04-08", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB1389/id/262806", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/112/bills/hr1389/BILLS-112hr1389ih.pdf", "text_size": 182652, "text_hash": "d552c983bf0c3a0f5007c4bdcb4d0124"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
