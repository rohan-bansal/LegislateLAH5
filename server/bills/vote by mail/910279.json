With instant runoff voting, voters rank the candidates for each office in order of choice, and only the candidate receiving a majority of the votes for such office is declared the winner. Ballots are initially counted as one vote for the first-choice candidate on the ballot; if no candidate receives a majority of the first-choice votes, additional rounds of ballot counting are required. In subsequent rounds of counting, each ballot is counted as one vote for that ballot's highest-ranked advancing candidate and the candidate receiving the fewest votes is eliminated, until one candidate receives a majority of the valid votes in a round.", "pending_committee_id": 156, "committee": {"committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-12", "committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-12", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 17101738D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-12", "action": "Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-16", "action": "Assigned P & E sub: Campaigns", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-26", "action": "Subcommittee recommends laying on the table by voice vote", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-02-08", "action": "Left in Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 17740, "person_hash": "7nw83gkc", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Nicholas Freitas", "first_name": "Nicholas", "middle_name": "J.", "last_name": "Freitas", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-030", "ftm_eid": 32011420, "votesmart_id": 156651, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 533261, "ballotpedia": "Nick_Freitas", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 215, "subject_name": "Elections"}, {"subject_id": 225, "subject_name": "General Assembly"}, {"subject_id": 295, "subject_name": "United States Government"}, {"subject_id": 169232, "subject_name": "Voters and Voting"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1456767, "date": "2017-01-12", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2315/id/1456767", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+HB2315+hil", "text_size": 5796, "text_hash": "1402e98dbc6e1607c7ba87007969739c"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-26", "time": "00:00", "location": "5th Floor West Conference Room", "description": "House Privileges and Elections - Campaigns Subcommittee Hearing"}]}}
