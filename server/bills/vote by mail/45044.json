Increases the deadline for each electoral board to make absentee ballots available from 45 to 50 days prior to any November general election or special election held at the same time, and from 30 to 35 days prior to any other general, special, or primary election. Each electoral board must report to the State Board of Elections whether it has complied with these deadlines no later than five days after absentee ballots are made available. The bill also provides that making absentee ballots available includes mailing the ballot or electronic transmission of the ballot to an absentee voter who is eligible for an absentee ballot due to active duty military service, membership in the merchant marines, or temporary residence outside of the country, or to the spouse or dependent residing with such a voter, and that absentee ballots shall be provided to such voters within three business days upon receiving the voter's application. The bill further provides that absentee ballots cast by such voters will still be counted even if received after the close of the polls on election day if the ballot was received before the State Board meets to ascertain the results of the election.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2010-01-13", "action": "Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/10 10103634D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-01-13", "action": "Senate: Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2010-01-26", "action": "Senate: Assigned to P&E sub: Campaigns and Elections", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2010-02-09", "action": "Senate: Incorporated by Privileges and Elections (SB55-Martin) (15-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 771, "person_hash": "1bbyorba", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Robert Hurt", "first_name": "Robert", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Hurt", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-019", "ftm_eid": 6613951, "votesmart_id": 50895, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 209948, "ballotpedia": "Robert_Hurt", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 775, "person_hash": "ldoecdj2", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Stephen Martin", "first_name": "Stephen", "middle_name": "H.", "last_name": "Martin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-011", "ftm_eid": 6344217, "votesmart_id": 5103, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199393, "ballotpedia": "Steve_Martin_(Virginia)", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 796, "person_hash": "jxm8bwyx", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Jill Vogel", "first_name": "Jill", "middle_name": "Holtzman", "last_name": "Vogel", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-027", "ftm_eid": 5973939, "votesmart_id": 69999, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 260387, "ballotpedia": "Jill_Vogel", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 414582, "date": "2010-01-13", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB482/id/414582", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+SB482+hil", "text_size": 19191, "text_hash": "00e019e39d0ab80a66633a334a7f2cc5"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 118473, "date": "2010-02-09", "desc": "Senate: Incorporated by Privileges and Elections ", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB482/id/118473", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+vot+S08V0061+SB0482"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
