Provides that the amount due may include any attorney's fees and court costs, but may not exceed 9 months of regular assessments due over the same 9-month period. Deletes language providing that the purchaser shall have the duty to pay the proportionate share, if any, of the common expenses for the unit which would have become due in the absence of any assessment acceleration for the 6 months immediately preceding the institution of an action to enforce the collection of assessments, and which remain unpaid. Deletes language providing that if the outstanding assessments are paid at any time during an action to enforce the collection of assessments, the purchaser shall have no obligation to pay any assessments which accrued before he or she acquired title. Provides that the notice of a foreclosure sale of a condominium unit shall state that a purchaser, other than a mortgagee, shall pay to the association any unpaid monthly assessments for the 9-month period preceding the sale, including attorney's fees and court costs. Provides that each offer of sale or contract for the sale of a condominium unit under the new provisions shall state that the purchaser of the unit shall pay to the association the fees required by the new provisions, and that each disclosure statement issued to a prospective purchaser shall list the required fees.
