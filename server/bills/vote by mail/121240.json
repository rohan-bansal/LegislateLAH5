This section amends Section 132(b) to clarify that such subsection applies to registered agents for both domestic corporations and foreign corporations. Section 5.

Section 6. The amendment to Section 145(e) clarifies that the first sentence of Section 145(e) is intended to apply to advancement of expenses to present officers and directors of the corporation providing the advancement (and not to advancement to persons serving at the request of the corporation as officers and directors of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) and further clarifies that expenses may be advanced to persons serving at the request of the corporation as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.

Section 26. This amendment to Section 278 confirms that the provisions of Section 279 through Section 282, including those provisions dealing with winding up of a corporation, apply to a corporation that has expired by its own limitation. Section 28. This section amends Section 371(b)(1) to require that the certificate from the jurisdiction of the foreign corporation\u2019s incorporation to be filed thereunder must be as of a date not earlier than 6 months prior to the filing date.
