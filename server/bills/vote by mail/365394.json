Establishes a credit beginning in taxable year 2013 for individuals, business entities, and corporations making monetary donations to nonprofit organizations providing education improvement scholarships to students whose family's annual household income is not in excess of 300 percent of the current poverty guidelines and certain students with disabilities, in order for them to attend nonpublic elementary or secondary schools. Nonprofit organizations to which donations are made would be required to distribute at least 90 percent of such donations in the form of scholarships to such students. The credit would equal 65 percent of the donation made and any unused credit for the taxable year could be carried forward for five years. There is an annual cap of $25 million in tax credits for the scholarship program. The Department of Education would administer the tax credit program. The bill also expands the current Neighborhood Assistance Act Tax Credit program by increasing the tax credit percentage from 40 to 65 percent; raising the cap on education proposals from $4.9 million to $8 million, which has the effect of raising the total cap on the program from $11.9 million to $15 million; expanding the eligibility criteria for programs qualifying for tax credits to encompass programs providing services to certain students with disabilities and individuals whose family's annual household income is not in excess of 300 percent of the poverty guidelines; allowing unused credits at the end of the year to be distributed to neighborhood organizations that had previously met the $500,000 cap on tax credits; and extending the sunset for the program to July 1, 2017.",
