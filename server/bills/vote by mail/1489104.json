In addition, the bill requires IHEs to use a specified portion of federal work-study grants to compensate students who are employed in civic engagement activities, including voter registration, nonpartisan voter engagement, and voter participation work.", "pending_committee_id": 3789, "committee": {"committee_id": 3789, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education and Labor"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-03-26", "committee_id": 3789, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education and Labor"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-03-26", "action": "Introduced in House", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-03-26", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-03-26", "action": "Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 18316, "person_hash": "kvbno8r6", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Raja Krishnamoorthi", "first_name": "Raja", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Krishnamoorthi", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-IL-8", "ftm_eid": 6265333, "votesmart_id": 117519, "opensecrets_id": "N00033240", "knowwho_pid": 385662, "ballotpedia": "Raja_Krishnamoorthi", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "SB992", "sast_bill_id": 1488620}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13329, "subject_name": "Education"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13171, "subject_name": "Education programs funding"}, {"subject_id": 13534, "subject_name": "Educational technology and distance education"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13215, "subject_name": "Higher education"}, {"subject_id": 13434, "subject_name": "Voting rights"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2407236, "date": "2021-05-28", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB2232/id/2407236", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2232/BILLS-117hr2232ih.pdf", "text_size": 271572, "text_hash": "48591ac05444e0ca81b576aa45523967"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
