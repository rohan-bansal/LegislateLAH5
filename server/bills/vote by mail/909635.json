Requires the officers of election to compare the signature on an absentee ballot envelope with the signature on that voter's voter registration application. Three officers, including one representative of each political party, are required to agree that the signatures match in order for the absentee ballot to be accepted. If less than three agree, the ballot and application are later reviewed by the electoral board at its meeting held on the day after election day. If the electoral board determines that the signature on the ballot envelope and the voter's voter registration application match, the ballot is counted. However, if the electoral board determines that the signatures do not match, the ballot is not counted. The bill requires that, when the electoral board determines the signatures do not match, copies of the ballot envelope and the voter registration application are to be provided to the appropriate attorney for the Commonwealth. The voter is required to be notified in writing of the decision of and actions taken by the electoral board.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2017-01-10", "committee_id": 167, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}], "history": [{"date": "2017-01-10", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/17 17103095D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2017-01-10", "action": "Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2017-01-24", "action": "Stricken at request of Patron in Privileges and Elections (14-Y 0-N)", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 783, "person_hash": "3e7rj9m1", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mark Obenshain", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "D.", "last_name": "Obenshain", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-026", "ftm_eid": 5883443, "votesmart_id": 50954, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 219692, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Obenshain", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 215, "subject_name": "Elections"}, {"subject_id": 169232, "subject_name": "Voters and Voting"}, {"subject_id": 169251, "subject_name": "Absentee Ballots"}, {"subject_id": 175208, "subject_name": "Voter Registration"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1456243, "date": "2017-01-10", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1252/id/1456243", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+SB1252+hil", "text_size": 13422, "text_hash": "84f7308d67220e6cab653d8278609e3f"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 570266, "date": "2017-01-24", "desc": "Senate: Stricken at request of Patron in Privileges and Elections (14-Y 0-N)", "yea": 14, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 14, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB1252/id/570266", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+vot+S08V0060+SB1252"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2017-01-24", "time": "00:00", "location": "Senate Room A", "description": "Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections Hearing"}]}}
