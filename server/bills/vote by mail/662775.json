(The cohort default rate represents the percentage of a school's borrowers who begin to repay Federal Family Education Loans [FFELs] or William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans [DLs] in a fiscal year but default on those loans before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year they began repaying them.) Directs the Secretary to establish an Institutional Risk-Sharing Commission to study and make recommendations for the implementation of a new risk-sharing system that holds IHEs that participate in the DL program financially accountable for poor student outcomes. Authorizes the Secretary to:    impose a civil penalty on IHEs that engage in certain substantial misrepresentations or other serious HEA violations;   impose smaller civil penalties on IHEs that engage in less serious title IV violations;   impose employment sanctions and civil penalties against the officer of an IHE who knowingly and willfully, or with gross negligence, violates a title IV provision;  limit, suspend, or terminate an IHE's participation in title IV programs for violating a title IV provision or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation; and take emergency action to withhold funds from an IHE or its students and withdraw the IHE's authority to obligate title IV funds in certain circumstances where immediate action is required to prevent the misuse of federal funds.  Provides for the use of the civil penalties to: (1) conduct program reviews and ensure the integrity of IHEs participating or seeking to participate in title IV programs; and (2) finance a Student Relief Fund that is to be used to provide financial relief to any student enrolled in an IHE that fails to comply with the HEA's eligibility requirements or the terms of its title IV program participation agreement or that has been sanctioned pursuant to this Act's penalty provisions.", "pending_committee_id": 2328, "committee": {"committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2014-12-10", "committee_id": 2328, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}], "history": [{"date": "2014-12-10", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 8986, "person_hash": "m2pvngcc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Christopher Murphy", "first_name": "Christopher", "middle_name": "S.", "last_name": "Murphy", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-CT-5", "ftm_eid": 6384200, "votesmart_id": 17189, "opensecrets_id": "N00027566", "knowwho_pid": 193324, "ballotpedia": "Chris_Murphy_(Connecticut)", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}, {"people_id": 9419, "person_hash": "75ev2noc", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Tom Harkin", "first_name": "Tom", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Harkin", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-IA", "ftm_eid": 0, "votesmart_id": 53294, "opensecrets_id": "N00004207", "knowwho_pid": 165216, "ballotpedia": "Tom_Harkin", "sponsor_type_id": 2, "sponsor_order": 2, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 8, "type": "Related", "sast_bill_number": "SB2954", "sast_bill_id": 660674}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13125, "subject_name": "Academic performance and assessments"}, {"subject_id": 13127, "subject_name": "Advisory bodies"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13146, "subject_name": "Congressional oversight"}, {"subject_id": 13154, "subject_name": "Department of Education"}, {"subject_id": 13170, "subject_name": "Education of the disadvantaged"}, {"subject_id": 13171, "subject_name": "Education programs funding"}, {"subject_id": 13184, "subject_name": "Executive agency funding and structure"}, {"subject_id": 13202, "subject_name": "Government lending and loan guarantees"}, {"subject_id": 22688, "subject_name": "Government studies and investigations"}, {"subject_id": 13215, "subject_name": "Higher education"}, {"subject_id": 13258, "subject_name": "Performance measurement"}, {"subject_id": 13286, "subject_name": "Student aid and college costs"}, {"subject_id": 13329, "subject_name": "Education"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 1056872, "date": "2014-12-16", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB2993/id/1056872", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/s2993/BILLS-113s2993is.pdf", "text_size": 287072, "text_hash": "9d972ff58ca03e05405099a811e01a2b"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
