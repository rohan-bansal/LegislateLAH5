Allows any additional surplus contributions to be used for repayment of debts incurred by USPS or for making required payments to the Employees' Compensation Fund, USPS retiree health benefits funds, and the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.  (Sec. 102) Allows USPS to: (1) provide voluntary separation incentive payments of up to $25,000 to USPS employees who voluntarily separate before October 1, 2015; and (2) offer up to one year of additional creditable service for postal employees in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) who voluntarily separate from service before such date, and up to two years for employees in FERS who voluntarily separate from service before such date. Disqualifies any employee who receives such additional credits from receiving a voluntary separation incentive payment. Requires USPS to offer voluntary separation incentives to ensure that the size and cost of the USPS workforce is appropriate to perform its duties, taking into consideration the closure and consolidation of postal facilities, the ability of USPS employees to operate existing facilities more efficiently, and the number of employees eligible for retirement or early retirement. Establishes a goal for the reduction of USPS career employees of 18% by the end of FY2015. (Sec. 103) Restructures the pre-funding requirements for USPS retiree health benefits by replacing the current schedule of annual payments to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund with a schedule of annual installment payments that will liquidate pension liabilities by September 30, 2052, or within 15 years, whichever is later. Requires the government's contributions to be paid first, beginning with enactment of this Act, from the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund up to the amount contained in the Fund (currently, such contributions are to be paid by the Postal Service through September 30, 2016). Reduces the pre-funding requirement for retiree health benefits to 80% of projected liability (currently, 100%). (Sec. 104) Authorizes USPS to negotiate jointly with all employee bargaining representatives until the end of FY2012 to establish the Postal Service Health Benefits Program outside of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Sets forth the basic requirements for such Program, including that it provide coverage that is actuarially equivalent to the types of plans available under the FEHB Program. (Sec. 105) Requires the Postmaster General to develop an educational program for USPS employees and annuitants who may be eligible for Medicare to learn how Medicare benefits interact with and can supplement benefits under the FEHB Program. (Sec. 106) Requires any arbitration board deciding a contract dispute between USPS and labor organizations to: (1) render a decision not later than 45 days after the date of its appointment; and (2) consider such relevant factors as the financial condition of USPS.  (Sec. 107) Requires the Director of OPM to: (1) submit to Congress and the Comptroller General (GAO) not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act and every month thereafter a report that evaluates the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of USPS information on employee retirements; (2) post such information on the OPM website; and (3) submit to Congress and GAO a timetable for completion of each component of a retirement systems modernization project. (Sec. 108) Imposes limits on the rate of compensation, including bonuses, for certain USPS officers and employees. Title II: Postal Services and Operations - (Sec. 201) Requires USPS to maintain current delivery service standards during the three-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, including overnight standards for first-class mail and periodicals, two-day delivery for first-class mail, and a maximum delivery time for first-class mail of three days within the continental United States. (Sec. 202) Requires USPS, before making a determination as to the necessity for closing or consolidating any postal facility, to: (1) conduct an area mail processing study that includes a plan to reduce the capacity of, but not close, the facility and a consideration of the effect of the closure or consolidation on the ability of individuals to vote by mail and the ability of USPS to timely deliver ballots by mail; (2) provide notice of a determination to close or consolidate a postal facility to Congress, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), and state officials; (3) ensure that interested persons have an opportunity to submit public comments during a 45-day period after notice of intent to close or consolidate a postal facility is given; (4) consider such public comments and the effects of a proposed closure or consolidation within a 30-day period after the initial period for public comments; (5) publish on its website a justification statement for any closure or consolidation; and (6) wait 15 days after posting such justification statement before closing or consolidating a postal facility.  Prohibits the closure or consolidation of a postal facility during the three-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act if such closure or consolidation prevents USPS from maintaining current service standards. Allows any interested person to lodge a complaint with PRC if such person believes that the closure or consolidation of a postal facility is not in conformance with applicable service standards. (Sec. 203) Requires USPS, within six months after the enactment of this Act, to establish service standards for market-dominant products. (Sec. 204) Requires USPS, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to develop and submit to Congress a revised and updated version of the plan to expand and market retail access to postal services. (Sec. 205) Requires USPS, prior to closing or consolidating a post office, including a post office in a rural area, to consider: (1) alternatives, including reducing the hours of such post office; (2) the effects on the community and businesses served by such post office and on the employees of such post office; and (3) whether substantial economic savings to USPS would result. (Sec. 206) Requires USPS to submit to the House Committee on Oversight and Governmental Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs: (1) a comprehensive strategic plan to govern decisions relating to area and district office structure; and (2) a 10-year plan, including a timetable, that provides for consolidation of area and district offices. Requires an update to such plan at least once every five years.  Requires USPS, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to: (1) consolidate district offices that are located within 50 miles of each other, (2) consolidate area and district offices that have less than the mean mail volume and number of work hours for all such offices, and (3) relocate area offices to headquarters.  (Sec. 207) Prohibits USPS from establishing a general, nationwide delivery schedule of five or fewer days for at least 24 months after the enactment of this Act. Requires USPS, prior to implementing any five-day delivery schedule, to: (1) identify customers and communities for whom a change may have a disproportionate, negative impact; (2) develop measures to ameliorate any such impact; and (3) implement measures to increase revenue and reduce costs and evaluate whether such measures will allow USPS to achieve long-term financial solvency without implementing a five-day delivery schedule. Requires GAO to report on whether USPS has complied with measures for implementing any change in its delivery schedule and whether a change in its delivery schedule is necessary to allow USPS to achieve long-term solvency. Requires USPS to ensure that any change in its delivery schedule will not result in more than two consecutive days without mail delivery, including recognized federal holidays. (Sec. 208) Requires USPS to request the PRC to issue an advisory opinion relating to any change in the USPS delivery schedule. Requires PRC to issue such advisory opinion within 90 days. (Sec. 209) Requires USPS to: (1) provide at least 30 days' notice of any proposed changes to mailing specifications not reviewed by PRC and to respond to public comments on such changes, and (2) analyze the financial impact of such proposed changes on USPS and its customers.  (Sec. 210) Authorizes USPS to provide other services that are not postal services after PRC determines that providing such services: (1) makes use of the processing, transportation, delivery, retail network, or technology of USPS; (2) would be consistent with the public interest and would not create unfair competition with the private sector; and (3) would have the potential to improve the financial position of USPS. (Sec. 211) Establishes in USPS the position of Chief Innovation Officer to be appointed by the Postmaster General. Requires such Innovation Officer to have proven expertise and a record of accomplishment in areas such as: (1) the postal and shipping industry; (2) innovative product research and development; (3) brand marketing strategy; (4) new and emerging technologies, including communications technology; or (5) business process management.  Requires the Chief Innovation Officer to report to Congress on a comprehensive strategy for improving the net financial position of USPS through innovation, including the offering of new postal and nonpostal products and services. (Sec. 212) Establishes in USPS a Strategic Advisory Commission on Postal Service Solvency and Innovation as an independent commission to provide strategic guidance to the President, Congress, the Board of Governors of the Postal Service, and the Postmaster General on enhancing the long-term solvency of USPS and to foster innovative thinking to address the challenges facing USPS. (Sec. 213) Authorizes the appointment of a citizen's service protection advocate to represent the interests of postal customers affected by the proposed closing or consolidation of a postal facility. Requires USPS to provide such advocate with information and assistance relating to any closing or consolidation. (Sec. 214) Prohibits USPS from maintaining or operating more than one post office in the U.S. Capitol Complex in a House Office Building or in a Senate Office Building. Title III: Federal Employees' Compensation Act - Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 2012 - (Sec. 302) Amends the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) to revise benefit payments for FECA enrollees. Reduces FECA benefits for totally disabled enrollees to 50% of their pre-disability pay upon the enrollee reaching full retirement age, as defined in the Social Security Act. Exempts any enrollee who: (1) has attained retirement age by the date of enactment of this Act, (2) is an individual who has an exempt disability condition, or (3) is a member of a household that meets eligibility requirements for the supplemental nutrition assistance programs (SNAP). (Sec. 303) Eliminates augmented compensation under FECA for dependents of postal employees who have a work-related injury. Exempts employees who are totally disabled and allows augmented compensation, for three years after the enactment of this title, for employees who are partially disabled.

(Sec. 311) Allows the federal government to recover continuation of pay (i.e., salary that is continued to be paid during the 45-day period between the beneficiary's injury and the start of FECA disability benefits) from third parties who are liable for the beneficiary's work-related injury. (Sec. 312) Directs the Secretary to establish an Integrity and Compliance Program (Program) and cooperate with other federal agencies to prevent, identify, and recover fraudulent and other improper payments for the FECA program.

Requires the establishment of protocols for the secure transfer and storage of any information provided under the Program. Requires GAO to conduct periodic audits of the Program. (Sec. 313) Increases to $50,000 the benefit amount for a severe disfigurement of the face, head, or neck.
