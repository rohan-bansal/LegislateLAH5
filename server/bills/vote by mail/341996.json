(In effect reverses the NLRB's August 26, 2011, decision in Specialty Healthcare and Rehabilitation of Mobile and its June 22, 2011, rulemaking regarding proposed changes to procedures involving the election of collective bargaining representation.) Replaces the current restriction in the meaning of collective bargaining unit to employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision. Requires the NLRB, instead, to determine a unit as appropriate for collective bargaining if it consists of employees that share a sufficient community of interest. Specifies factors the NLRB must consider when making such determinations. Prohibits exclusion of employees from the unit unless the group's interest are sufficiently distinct from those of other employees to warrant the establishment of a separate unit.  Requires the NLRB, upon due notice, to provide a hearing at least 14 days after the filing of an election petition for collective bargaining representation to investigate those petitions the NLRB has reasonable cause to believe have a question of representation affecting commerce. Requires such hearings be non-adversarial. Requires the NLRB to: (1) direct an election by secret ballot as soon as practicable, but in any event not before 35 calendar days following the filing of an election petition, in cases where a question of representation exists; and (2) acquire, at least 7 days after its final determination of the appropriate bargaining unit, a list of all eligible voters (including certain informational data) from the employer and make it available to all parties.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2011-10-05", "committee_id": 2301, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "name": "Education And The Workforce"}], "history": [{"date": "2011-10-05", "action": "Referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-10-12", "action": "Committee Hearings Held.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-10-26", "action": "Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2011-10-26", "action": "Ordered to be Reported (Amended).", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 114, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2011-11-10", "action": "Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Education and the Workforce.
