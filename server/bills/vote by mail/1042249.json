Part II: Clarifies that when a unit owner and association reach a payment plan to cure a nonjudicial foreclosure, completion of the payment plan is required to cure the default; specifies that if a unit owner and an association have agreed on a payment plan to prevent a nonjudicial foreclosure from proceeding, any association fines imposed while the payment plan is in effect shall not be deemed a default under the payment plan; and clarifies the obligations of a unit owner and an association while a unit owner is not otherwise in default under a payment plan. Part III: Clarifies that the pay first, dispute later provisions in Hawaii's condominium law apply only to common expense assessments claimed by an association of apartment owners; specifies that a unit or apartment owner who disputes the amount of an assessment may request a written statement about the assessment from the association, including that a unit or apartment owner may demand mediation prior to paying contested charges, other than common expense assessments; specifies requirements for mediation on contested charges, except for common expense assessments; and repeals language that permitted associations to convert delinquent fines and late fees into delinquent common expense assessments, if certain conditions were met.
