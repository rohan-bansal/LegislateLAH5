Specifically, the bill requires each state and jurisdiction to, within 30 days, create and publish a plan to operate their federal elections if a significant number of voters or poll workers are quarantined due to COVID-19. Such plan must (1) permit registered voters to submit online requests for absentee ballots and vote in federal elections by mail, and (2) extend vote-by-mail deadlines if postal service is disrupted as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, when at least 25% of states have declared an emergency due to any single natural disaster or infectious disease, including COVID-19, states must allow registered voters to vote by absentee ballot, permit voters to submit online requests for absentee ballots, allow voters to receive electronic (i.e., print-at-home) ballots, accept absentee-ballot requests up to five days before an election for mailed ballots and one day before the election for print-at-home ballots, and accept ballots postmarked on or before the date of the election. The bill also provides for an emergency voting period if a state governor declares a state of emergency. States and jurisdictions must provide self-sealing return envelopes with prepaid postage for voter registration applications, absentee-ballot applications, and blank absentee ballots. The Election Assistance Commission must reimburse states for the costs of doing so.", "pending_committee_id": 2331, "committee": {"committee_id": 2331, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Rules And Administration"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2020-03-11", "committee_id": 2331, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "name": "Rules And Administration"}], "history": [{"date": "2020-03-11", "action": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 115, "importance": 1}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 9417, "person_hash": "9kl7g1rn", "party_id": "1", "state_id": 52, "party": "D", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Ron Wyden", "first_name": "Ron", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Wyden", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-OR", "ftm_eid": 5397600, "votesmart_id": 27036, "opensecrets_id": "N00007724", "knowwho_pid": 165265, "ballotpedia": "Ron_Wyden", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Same As", "sast_bill_number": "HB6202", "sast_bill_id": 1359194}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 13356, "subject_name": "Government operations and politics"}, {"subject_id": 13783, "subject_name": "Cardiovascular and respiratory health"}, {"subject_id": 13322, "subject_name": "Civil actions and liability"}, {"subject_id": 13439, "subject_name": "Disaster relief and insurance"}, {"subject_id": 13494, "subject_name": "Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}, {"subject_id": 13308, "subject_name": "Emergency medical services and trauma care"}, {"subject_id": 13397, "subject_name": "Government liability"}, {"subject_id": 13706, "subject_name": "Infectious and parasitic diseases"}, {"subject_id": 13231, "subject_name": "Intergovernmental relations"}, {"subject_id": 13442, "subject_name": "Natural disasters"}, {"subject_id": 13355, "subject_name": "Postal service"}, {"subject_id": 13284, "subject_name": "State and local finance"}, {"subject_id": 13285, "subject_name": "State and local government operations"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2175460, "date": "2020-03-24", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/US/text/SB3440/id/2175460", "state_link": "https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3440/BILLS-116s3440is.pdf", "text_size": 337397, "text_hash": "1c40475befa5000443ac3d71cbdc3244"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
