Requires certain actions to be taken to process absentee ballots that are returned by mail before election day. The general registrar is required to examine the ballot envelopes to verify completion of the required voter affirmation; mark the pollbook, or the absentee voter applicant list if the pollbook is not available, that the voter has voted; and open the sealed ballot envelopes and insert the ballots in optical scan counting equipment or other secure ballot container without initiating any ballot count totals. Current law requires only that the general registrar undertake at least one such activity before election day. So that ballots can be separated from ballot envelopes and scanned, the bill requires that the office of the general registrar be used as a central absentee voter precinct. The bill requires that absentee ballots processed at any central absentee voter precinct be sorted by the precinct to which the voter who cast the absentee ballot is assigned and that the resulting vote totals from such ballots be reported separately for each voter precinct.", "pending_committee_id": 156, "committee": {"committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2021-01-13", "committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}, {"date": "2021-01-15", "committee_id": 4344, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections: Election Administration"}, {"date": "2021-02-05", "committee_id": 156, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Privileges and Elections"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-01-13", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/21 21101712D", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-13", "action": "Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2021-01-15", "action": "Assigned P & E sub: Election Administration", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-01-26", "action": "Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (4-Y 2-N)", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2021-02-05", "action": "Left in Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 11025, "person_hash": "ny5zodq2", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 1, "role": "Rep", "name": "Roxann Robinson", "first_name": "Roxann", "middle_name": "L.", "last_name": "Robinson", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "HD-027", "ftm_eid": 6699982, "votesmart_id": 127380, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 295876, "ballotpedia": "Roxann_Robinson", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [], "texts": [{"doc_id": 2239142, "date": "2021-01-13", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB2239/id/2239142", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+ful+HB2239+hil", "text_size": 21024, "text_hash": "1ba2a1bd8e9212496421b388ff08d9c3"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 990418, "date": "2021-01-26", "desc": "House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (4-Y 2-N)", "yea": 4, "nay": 2, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 6, "passed": 1, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/HB2239/id/990418", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+vot+H1801V0020+HB2239"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [{"supplement_id": 130833, "date": "2021-01-18", "type": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "type_id": 3, "title": "Fiscal Note/Analysis", "description": "House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/13/21 21101712D", "mime": "application/pdf", "mime_id": 2, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/supplement/HB2239/id/130833", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+oth+HB2239F122+PDF", "supplement_size": 71264, "supplement_hash": "8e2466bcca3de127d0813aa3e3aa4a1e"}], "calendar": [{"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2021-01-19", "time": "00:00", "location": "Virtual Meeting", "description": "House Privileges and Elections - Election Administration Subcommittee Hearing"}, {"type_id": 1, "type": "Hearing", "date": "2021-01-26", "time": "00:00", "location": "Virtual Meeting", "description": "House Privileges and Elections - Election Administration Subcommittee Hearing"}]}}
