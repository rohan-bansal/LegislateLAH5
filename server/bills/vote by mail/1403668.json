Allows the office of the secretary of family and social services to apply for a Medicaid state plan amendment to allow school corporations to seek Medicaid reimbursement for medically necessary, school based Medicaid covered services that are provided under federal or state mandates. Specifies possible services for Medicaid reimbursement. Adds physical therapy to the list of services for which a school psychologist may refer a student. Establishes the long term care insurance partnership program and requires the office of the secretary of family and social services to apply before September 1, 2021, for a Medicaid state plan amendment that would: (1) provide for the establishment of the new long term care insurance partnership program and the discontinuance of the current long term care program; and (2) ensure that an individual who purchased a qualified long term care policy under the current program will be eligible for an asset disregard even if the current program is discontinued and even though the policy was issued before the date of the state plan amendment, is not tax qualified, and does not meet the standards of Section 6021 the federal Deficit Reduction Act. Provides that if approval is not given for the state plan amendment, the new long term care insurance partnership program is not established and the office and the department of insurance shall study ways to improve the affordability and cost effectiveness of the current program. Requires an audit examining prescription drug cost sharing for the Medicaid program once every three state fiscal years. Provides that the county sheriff may receive reimbursement from a nonincarcerated person's health coverage for providing nonemergency transport of the person to a facility for a mental health detention. Requires a provider to provide the health records requested by a patient within 30 days after the date the written request is made, unless the provider seeks an extension of not more than 30 days and informs the patient in writing of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the provider will provide the health records. Prohibits the state or a local unit from issuing or requiring a COVID-19 \"immunization passport\" (a document concerning an individual's immunization status).

Prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) from: (1) imposing limits on a pharmacy's access to medication that differ from those existing for a PBM affiliate; or (2) sharing any covered individual's information, except as permitted by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Prohibits the inclusion of certain provisions in a contract between a PBM and an entity authorized to participate in the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program, with certain exceptions. Requires a PBM: (1) to update the PBM's maximum allowable cost list at least every seven days; (2) to determine that a prescription drug is not obsolete, is generally available for purchase by pharmacies, and is not temporarily unavailable, listed on a drug shortage list, or unable to be lawfully substituted before placing the prescription drug on a maximum allowable cost list. Provides that: (1) if a PBM approves an appeal concerning maximum allowable cost pricing, the PBM must notify each pharmacy in the PBM's network that the maximum allowable cost for the drug has been adjusted; and (2) if a PBM denies an appeal, the PBM must provide the reason for the denial and other information, and the appealing pharmacy or other entity may then file a complaint with the department of insurance (department). Also allows a contracted pharmacy or pharmacy services administrative organization to file a complaint with the department if it believes that its contract with a PBM contains an unlawful contractual provision. Provides that a PBM's violation of these requirements or prohibitions is an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance. Amends code sections requiring an insurer to \"deliver\" or \"provide\" certain notices within a certain time period to make those sections provide instead that the insurer is required to \"mail\" the notices.

Amends the law requiring an insurer to provide 10 days' advance notice to the insurance producer who procured an automobile policy when the insurer intends to cancel or not to renew the policy to make the law applicable only if the insurance producer who procured the policy was an independent insurance producer. Requires the state department of health, in consultation with the department of insurance, the office of the secretary of family and social services, and the Indiana board of pharmacy, to submit to the legislative council a report concerning: (1) best practice guidelines in providing specialty drugs in a manner that ensures the patient's safety; and (2) information concerning any adverse events affecting the safety of patients resulting from the specialty drug protocols of a health carrier or hospital.
