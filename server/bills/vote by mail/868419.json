This Act also makes a greater distinction between a CPA who passed the CPA exam only and a CPA who passed the CPA exam, met the experience requirements, and received a permit to practice. This provides the public with the significant distinction between a CPA who is a certificate holder only, and a CPA who is a permit holder. It also provides for a peer review for those accounting firms that perform attest services as a requirement for permit renewal as a mechanism to ensure practice competency.
