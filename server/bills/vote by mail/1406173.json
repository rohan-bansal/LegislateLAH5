Authorizes the State Board of Health to use the Onsite Sewage Indemnification Fund to provide grants and loans to property owners with income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines to repair failing onsite sewage systems or install onsite sewage systems on properties that lack adequate sewage disposal. The bill provides that no expenses shall be paid from the Fund to support the program for training and recognition of onsite soil evaluators, or to provide grants or loans to repair failing onsite sewage systems or install onsite sewage systems on properties that lack adequate sewage disposal in lieu of payment to any owner or owners qualified to receive payment from the Fund. The bill also directs the Board to adopt regulations that include consideration of the impacts of climate change on proposed treatment works. The bill sets out the policy of the Commonwealth regarding wastewater infrastructure and establishes the four-member Wastewater Infrastructure Policy Working Group as an advisory board in the executive branch of state government to continually assess wastewater infrastructure needs and develop policy recommendations. The bill provides that the Working Group shall expire in 2030. The bill also directs the Department of Environmental Quality, in partnership with the Virginia Department of Health and in consultation with stakeholders, to estimate and report every four years the amount of wastewater infrastructure funding that is necessary to meet policy goals but is not eligible to be covered by grant funding pursuant to the Virginia Water Quality Improvement Act of 1997.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2021-01-13", "committee_id": 160, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources"}, {"date": "2021-01-26", "committee_id": 164, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Finance and Appropriations"}, {"date": "2021-02-07", "committee_id": 146, "chamber": "H", "chamber_id": 7, "name": "Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources"}], "history": [{"date": "2021-01-13", "action": "Prefiled and ordered printed;
