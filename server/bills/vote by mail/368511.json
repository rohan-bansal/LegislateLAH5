Voters may change their party affiliation or independent status by written notice at any time before the registration records are closed in advance of an election. The state party chairman must notify the State Board by January 31 of each year whether the party will close or open its primaries. Further, the bill (i) adds a requirement that primary candidate petitions must be signed by voters registered as members of the party conducting the primary, (ii) sets the required number of petition signatures at one percent of the number of voters registered as members of the party in the election district where the primary is being held, and (iii) allows an official political party to retain that status so long as at least 15 percent of the Commonwealth's registered voters are registered as members of that party.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [], "history": [{"date": "2012-01-10", "action": "Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01/11/12 12102755D", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-10", "action": "Senate: Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2012-01-31", "action": "Senate: Incorporated by Privileges and Elections ", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-31", "action": "Senate: Incorporated by Privileges and Elections ", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2012-01-31", "action": "Senate: Incorporated by Privileges and Elections ", "chamber": "", "chamber_id": 0, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 783, "person_hash": "3e7rj9m1", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Mark Obenshain", "first_name": "Mark", "middle_name": "D.", "last_name": "Obenshain", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-026", "ftm_eid": 5883443, "votesmart_id": 50954, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 219692, "ballotpedia": "Mark_Obenshain", "sponsor_type_id": 0, "sponsor_order": 0, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [{"type_id": 2, "type": "Similar To", "sast_bill_number": "SB62", "sast_bill_id": 356291}], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 215, "subject_name": "Elections"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 538037, "date": "2012-01-10", "type": "Prefiled", "type_id": 11, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB244/id/538037", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+SB244+hil", "text_size": 18040, "text_hash": "9033ecb081b177f04c70258c4d429872"}], "votes": [{"roll_call_id": 148364, "date": "2012-01-31", "desc": "Senate: Incorporated by Privileges and Elections ", "yea": 15, "nay": 0, "nv": 0, "absent": 0, "total": 15, "passed": 1, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/rollcall/SB244/id/148364", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+vot+S08V0037+SB0244"}], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
