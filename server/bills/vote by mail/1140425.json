The time intervals for reregistration for each of the following four categories of reregistration do not materially change. The bill provides that (i) a person required to register, other than those persons convicted of a sexually violent offense or murder, shall reregister once each year during such person's birth month; current law is once each year from the date of initial registration; (ii) a person convicted of a sexually violent offense or murder shall reregister every three months, beginning in such person's birth month; current law is every 90 days from the date of initial registration; (iii) a person convicted of providing false information or failing to provide registration information, but not convicted of a sexually violent offense or murder, shall reregister every six months beginning with such person's birth month; current law is every 180 days from the date of such conviction; and (iv) a person convicted of providing false information or failing to provide registration information, when such person was included in the Registry for a sexually violent offense or murder, shall reregister every month; current law is every 30 days from the date of such conviction. The bill requires persons with a last name beginning with A through L to register from the first to the fifteenth of each required reporting month and persons with last names M through Z to register from the sixteenth to the last day of the month of each required reporting month. The bill also requires that for the period of July 1, 2020, to July 1, 2021, any person required to reregister shall continue to reregister with the State Police on such person's reregistration schedule in place prior to July 1, 2020, until such person has reregistered pursuant to the new reregistration schedule, at which time such person shall continue reregistering with the new schedule.
