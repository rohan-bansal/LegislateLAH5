Makes several changes to the revenues collected by the Commonwealth, and the distribution of such revenues, as follows: The bill raises the state sales and use tax from 4% to 4.5%, and designates the increased revenues for the Transportation Trust Fund, to be allocated in the same manner as other sales and use tax revenues designated for the Transportation Trust Fund. The bill provides that retail sales and hotel taxes on transient room rentals are computed based upon the total charges or the total price paid for the use or possession of the room. For those cases in which a hotel or similar establishment contracts with an intermediary to facilitate the sale of the room and the intermediary charges the customer for the room and such facilitation efforts, the bill requires the intermediary to separately state the taxes on the bill or invoice provided to the customer and to collect the taxes based upon the total charges or the total price paid for the use or possession of the room. Additional revenues generated by this change would be dedicated to transportation. The effective date of these provisions of the bill is January 1, 2014. The bill eliminates the statewide cents-per-gallon taxation of gasoline and blended fuel containing gasoline under the Virginia Fuels Act but leaves the current cents-per-gallon tax in place for other types of motor fuels. The bill establishes a new 5.5% tax on motor fuels sales based on the statewide average wholesale price of a gallon of self-service unleaded regular gasoline. The bill increases the registration fee for electric motor vehicles from $50 to $75, and levies the annual fee on alternative fuel vehicles.", "pending_committee_id": 164, "committee": {"committee_id": 164, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Finance and Appropriations"}, "referrals": [{"date": "2013-01-18", "committee_id": 164, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "name": "Finance and Appropriations"}], "history": [{"date": "2013-01-18", "action": "Presented and ordered printed 13103823D", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}, {"date": "2013-01-18", "action": "Referred to Committee on Finance", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 1}, {"date": "2013-02-06", "action": "Left in Finance", "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 8, "importance": 0}], "sponsors": [{"people_id": 797, "person_hash": "a5rvr70t", "party_id": "2", "state_id": 46, "party": "R", "role_id": 2, "role": "Sen", "name": "Frank Wagner", "first_name": "Frank", "middle_name": "W.", "last_name": "Wagner", "suffix": "", "nickname": "", "district": "SD-007", "ftm_eid": 6270516, "votesmart_id": 5199, "opensecrets_id": "", "knowwho_pid": 199443, "ballotpedia": "Frank_Wagner", "sponsor_type_id": 1, "sponsor_order": 1, "committee_sponsor": 0, "committee_id": 0, "state_federal": 0}], "sasts": [], "subjects": [{"subject_id": 174, "subject_name": "Administration of Government"}, {"subject_id": 277, "subject_name": "Sales and Use Tax"}, {"subject_id": 289, "subject_name": "Taxation"}, {"subject_id": 293, "subject_name": "Transportation"}], "texts": [{"doc_id": 698155, "date": "2013-01-18", "type": "Introduced", "type_id": 1, "mime": "text/html", "mime_id": 1, "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1328/id/698155", "state_link": "https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+SB1328+hil", "text_size": 177623, "text_hash": "0aa1d4dfdb80c679ed87f4b1a0293ebb"}], "votes": [], "amendments": [], "supplements": [], "calendar": []}}
