If a county, city, or town does not have GIS capabilities, the locality may request the Department of Elections to create a GIS map on its behalf and the Department of Elections shall create such a map. The bill requires the Department to review any ordinance and GIS map received and compare the boundaries contained within with the information in the voter registration system to ensure voters have been assigned to the correct districts and to notify localities of any corrections that may be necessary. The Department is further required to maintain and make available on its official website maps showing the current election district and precinct boundaries of each county and city.
