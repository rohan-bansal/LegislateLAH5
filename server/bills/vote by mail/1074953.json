Provides that when a person who intends to be a write-in candidate for an uncontested office has not timely filed nomination papers but has filed a written statement or notice of his or her intent, no primary ballot shall be printed (rather than requiring a primary ballot to be prepared and a primary election held). Removes language concerning requirements for the written statement or notice. Removes language providing that an election authority has no duty to conduct a primary and prepare a ballot for a uncontested office, unless the written statement or notice is filed in a timely manner. Provides that where no primary is held, a person intending to become a write-in candidate shall re-file a declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate for the consolidated election with the appropriate election authority or authorities. Provides that a write-in candidate's notarized declaration of intent needs to be filed no more than 106 days before a primary or election for write-in votes for the candidate to be counted. Provides that a declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate shall include specified information, otherwise, the declaration shall not be accepted. Provides that persons intending to become write-in candidates for President and Vice President or Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall file a joint declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate that identifies the candidate for each office. Provides that a vote cast for either candidate shall constitute a valid write-in vote for the team of candidates.", "pending_committee_id": 0, "committee": [], "referrals": [{"date": "2018-01-30", "committee_id": 254, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Assignments"}, {"date": "2018-02-07", "committee_id": 267, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Executive"}, {"date": "2018-02-08", "committee_id": 4046, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Election Law"}, {"date": "2018-04-27", "committee_id": 254, "chamber": "S", "chamber_id": 36, "name": "Assignments"}], "history": [{"date": "2018-01-30", "action": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.
